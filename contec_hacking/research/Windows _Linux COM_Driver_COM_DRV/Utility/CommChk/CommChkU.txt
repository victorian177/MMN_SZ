This is document for CommChk.exe program.

<<< What is CommChk.exe >>>
 This is Diagnostic Program for Serial Communications Port.
 This program can be used for Standard COM serial communications devices.

 CONTEC's communications boards should be setup to Standard COM before.

 When you use Windows 32bit Oparating System, you use CommChk.exe in i386 folder.
 When you use Windows 64bit Oparating System, you use CommChk.exe in amd64 folder.

<<< Environment >>>
 Basically, You have to prepare two COM ports which are connected by
 the crossed(reversed) cable on your PC.

 You also can use this software for one COM port without the cable like below.
 < COM-2PD(PCI)H >
  a.Using CH1 --- SW3 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off
  b.Using CH2 --- SW5 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off

 < COM-4PD(PCI)H >
  a.Using CH1 --- SW3 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off
  b.Using CH2 --- SW5 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off
  c.Using CH3 --- SW7 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off
  d.Using CH4 --- SW9 1-6  : on,off,off,on,on,off

 < COM-2PD(PCI), COM-2PD(PC)H >
  a.Using CH1 --- SW2 1-8  : on,off,off,on,on,off,off,off
  b.Using CH2 --- SW3 1-8  : on,off,off,on,on,off,off,off

 < COM-1D(PM) >
  SW1 1-8  : on,off,off,on,on,off,off,off

 < RS-232 communication port >
    You have to create Loopback Connector connected TxD to RxD, RTS to CTS, DTR to DSR.

    [Pin Assignment of 9 Pin Loopback Connector]
       TxD(3) - RxD(2)
       RTS(7) - CTS(8)
       DTR(4) - DSR(6)

    [Pin Assignment of 25 Pin Loopback Connector]
       TxD(2) - RxD(3)
       RTS(4) - CTS(5)
       DTR(20)- DSR(6)

<<< Operation >>>
[COM Setup : You can select the COM ports.]
 Device1, Device2 : COM1 to COM255
 Communication Settings
 Bits/Second(Baud rate) : 300,600,1200,2400,4800,9600,19200,38400,57600,115200,230400,460800, 921600
 Data Bits : 5, 6, 7, 8
 Stop Bits : 1, 1.5, 2
 Parity : Even, Odd, None

[Type of data : You can define the sending/receiving data.]
 Binary Codes : Sending/Receiving Data is 1 to 255 character code.
 Ascii String : You can define the Sending/Receiving Data.
 Definition String: The length of string should be under 1024 characters.

[Iterations : You can choose number of iterations ]
 Once : The test will be done once after you press "Start" button.
 Limited : You may setup "Num. of Iterations". This should be under 2,147,483,647.
 Infinity : The test will be continuing until you press "Stop" button.

[Test Item : You can confirm the result by status of each item.(OK/NG/--)]
 Open/Close the port every time 
 Port Open : Device1, Device2
 From Device1 to Device2 : Send the data from Device1 to Device2.
 From Device2 to Device1 : Send the data from Device2 to Device1.
   NG:OE -- OverRun Error occur.
   NG:FE -- Framing Error occur.
   NG:PE -- Parity Error occur.
 Port Close : Device1, Device2

[Iterations number] : You can confirm current number iterations number.

[Message] : You may receive any advices when the error occur.

[Start/Stop] : You can start/stop the test process whenever you want.

[Help] : You will display this file.

[End] : Termination this program file.

- Career at version up  CommChk.exe
=======================================
  Ver1.22 -> Ver1.23 2014/02/12 
  - When it is set to "Never" flow control, This has been fixed you can not communicate with COM-1xx(USB)H.
    [This behavior occurs only in Ver.1.22.]

  Ver1.20 -> Ver1.22 2013/02/05 
  - Added Flow Control item.

  Ver1.11 -> Ver1.20 2009/12/28 [ComSetupDisk2.00]
  - This application support Windows 64bit Operating Systems.(only "\amd64\CommChk.exe")

  Ver1.10 -> Ver1.11 2007/12/28 [ComSetupDisk1.90]
  - This application cannot open when Operation System without "MFC42.DLL". 
    It was corrected.

  Ver1.07 -> Ver1.10 2006/10/31
  - Added output log data.(Option switch "/D".)
  - Added PurgeComm mode. (Option swtich "/P",Non PurgeComm Mode.)
    Default mode PurgeComm mode.

  Ver1.05 -> Ver1.07 2005/08/19
  - After PortOpen, the PurgeComm processing was added.
  - When it set low baudrate,the time-out error is generated in the end of the transmission of all data.
    Afterwards,"Data Compare Error" is generated that send data different receive data.
    It is corrected.
  - When port open goes wrong, it corrects that there was a case where an 
    error was not returned.
  - When it set "send binary data" and set Data-bit excluding 8(ex.Data-bit equals 7.),"Data Compare Error" is generated.
    It is corrected.

@Ver1.00 -> Ver1.05 2004/06/24
  - If a stop button is pushed during communication, it will correct that 
  there is a case where it becomes impossible to OPEN a port next. 
    It corrects becoming an INVALID HANDLE error depending on timing.
  - A timeout setting value is changed.
  - A half-duplex setting item is added.
  - A communication error information display function is added.
  - When port open goes wrong, it corrects that there was a case where an 
    error was not returned.
  - It corrects that there was a case where communication stopped during 
    communication by the high-speed baudrate.

That' all
