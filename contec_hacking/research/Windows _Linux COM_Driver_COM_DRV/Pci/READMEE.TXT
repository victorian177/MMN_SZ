- Introduction
===============
 Thank you for purchasing this product.

  COM-DRV (W32) is software that enables you to use our serial communication boards
  such as PCI bus board and PCI Express bus board on Windows in the same way as the COM port of the personal computer.
  This makes it possible to perform various serial communications on Windows.

     - Transfer mode and terminator setting
         The following settings are available:
              > Full duplex (RTS and CTS connected)
              > Full duplex (RTS and CTS not used)
              > Half duplex
              > Terminator inserted
              > Terminator not inserted


- Cautions
==========
 - Setting COM ports
    You can set up the COM ports(data bits, parity, ...), using 
    "Ports in Control Panel" or "Mode command in Command Prompt".
    However COM application useally sets up these parameters.

 - About RAS and UPS
    You can use of "Remote Access Service(RAS)" and "Uninterruptible 
    Power Supply(UPS)".
    See the "On Line Help" in the Windows XX or "Windows XX set up 
    guide" for details such as RAS and UPS setting.
 - Programing
    You can use of Win32 COMM API and Communication Control.
    It supports the SerialPort class of .Net Framework 4.0 or later.
    However you can not use SerialPort in half-duplex.
    It supports pySerial 3.4.
    See the language references (Visual C++, Win32SDK, Visual C#.NET, Visual Basic.NET, 
    ...) for details such as API specification.

      14400, 19200, 28800, 38400, 57600, 115200
   
   - Upper limit of the baud rate
     The upper limit of the baud rate which can be set is dependent 
     on the processing capacity(operating rate) and load(simultaneous
     execution with another program, etc.) of the PC in use. 
     Communications at a rate higher that the upper limit will cause 
     communications errors(overrun, parity, framing).  Check the baud
     rate which can be set by actually conducting communications 
     using one of the "Hiper Terminal" utility with operating system.

    - Setting Half-duplex  
     Use Win32 API to set [RTS_CONTROL_TOGGLE] in the fRtsControl member of
     the DCB stucture.
     But, fRtsControl cannot set for Develop language. 
     Then, we wrote how to set half-duplex communication forcedly.

      1: [DeviceManeger]->[Ports(LPT&COM)]->[CONTEC Communication Port].
      2: [Setting Port]->[Advanced]->[Half duplex] check on.
      3: Reboot Operation System.
      
     This Setting Port Communicates half-duplex.

- Install
=========
 - This product install the files in the System directory and 
   "CONTEC" directory. 
   And, if another API-TOOL drivers have already been installed, the 
   files will be installed in that directory.
