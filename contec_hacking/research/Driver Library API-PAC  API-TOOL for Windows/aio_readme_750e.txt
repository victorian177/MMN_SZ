=======
  In the following cases, the maximum size of the buffer for bus master is limited.

  <a PC has the memory more than 4G Byte>
  In Windows 64 bit OS and Windows 32 bit OS, PAE (Physical Address Extension) is enabled.

  <a PC has the memory less than 4G Byte>
  In Windows 64 bit OS or Windows 32 bit OS, PAE (Physical Address Extension) is enabled, 
  and [Memory Reclaiming] functionality is enabled by BIOS setting of the PC (matherboard) 
  in which a board is plugged.

  * According to PC (motherboard), there is the case that [Memory Reclaiming] functionality 
  cannot be changed to Enabled/Disabled by BIOS setting, therefore, please confirm in advance.
