Schizophrenia (SZ), a mental illness marked by hallucinations, disorganized speech, thoughts, and behavior, causing a distorted perspective of reality. There is no objective scientific tool for schizophrenia diagnosis. Psychosis-related schizophrenia is diagnosed using psychiatric nosology, which is based on the subjective assessment of qualified clinicians. The ability to detect and treat schizophrenia early (pre-psychotic) has demonstrated that the onset of psychosis can be avoided. The lack of a non-psychosis dependent tool makes early treatment almost impossible. After first episode psychosis,treatment is more challenging, expensive, and occasionally lifelong, this makes the early, accurate, and definitive detection of schizophrenia a crucial issue that needs to be resolved. Through the use of features indicative of schizophrenic state that will be derived from the power spectral density (PSD), fuzzy-entropy, and mismatch-negativity (MMN) of scalp-acquired electroencephalography (EEG) signals, this project seeks to develop an instrument that accurately diagnoses schizophrenia in pre-psychotic and psychotic schizophrenia populations. These features will be passed to a features learner for learning and identification of schizophrenia characteristics. A point-of-care device will hopefully be created in the future after the performance of this classifier has been evaluated with clinical populations.
