FIRST THINGS FIRST
You need to learn a bit about Latex and then download a good editor. Here's how I suggest you approach it:

i. Do some general reading about Latex to understand the philosophy, tools, workflow etc [estimated time required: 120 minutes]

ii. Install the tools you need. I recommend the following
	- MikTex - the Latex distro
	- TexStudio - the editor

iii. You will pick up Latex syntax as you go. The syntax of the language is straightforward, but because there are so many control and formatting options, there is A LOT of syntax. For your theses however, here are the topics that should be most relevant:
	i. How to specify new paragraphs, section, subsection, etc
	ii. How to insert tables
	iii. How to insert figures
	iv. Adding references to your bibliography, and citing them within the thesis. All I will say here is: use BibTex style. Search for the reference on Google Scholar, and download the BibTex citation.
	v. Inserting special characters.
	vi. Inserting equations. To get you started with the last two items, there is a pdf document in the help folder with the latex commands for the most common symbols.
