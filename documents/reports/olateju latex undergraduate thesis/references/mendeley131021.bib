abstract = {The ease with which we perform tasks such as opening the lid of a jar, in which the two hands execute quite different actions, belies the fact that there is a strong tendency for the movements of the upper limbs to be drawn systematically towards one another. Mirror movements, involuntary contractions during intended unilateral engagement of the opposite limb, are considered pathological, as they occur in association with specific disorders of the CNS. Yet they are also observed frequently in normally developing children, and motor irradiation, an increase in the excitability of the (opposite) homologous motor pathways when unimanual movements are performed, is a robust feature of the mature motor system. The systematic nature of the interactions that occur between the upper limbs has also given rise to the expectation that functional improvements in the control of a paretic limb may occur when movements are performed in a bimanual context. In spite of the ubiquitous nature of these phenomena, there is remarkably little consensus concerning the neural basis of their mediation. In the present review, consideration is given to the putative roles of uncrossed corticofugal fibers, branched bilateral corticomotoroneuronal projections, and segmental networks. The potential for bilateral interactions to occur in various brain regions including the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, non-primary motor areas, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum is also explored. This information may provide principled bases upon which to evaluate and develop task and deficit-specific programs of movement rehabilitation and therapy. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {After stroke, the function of primary motor cortex (M1) between the hemispheres may become unbalanced. Techniques that promote a re-balancing of M1 excitability may prime the brain to be more responsive to rehabilitation therapies and lead to improved functional outcomes. The present study examined the effects of Active-Passive Bilateral Therapy (APBT), a putative movement-based priming strategy designed to reduce intracortical inhibition and increase excitability within the ipsilesional M1. Thirty-two patients with upper limb weakness at least 6 months after stroke were randomized to a 1-month intervention of self-directed motor practice with their affected upper limb (control group) or to APBT for 10-15 min prior to the same motor practice (APBT group). A blinded clinical rater assessed upper limb function at baseline, and immediately and 1 month after the intervention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess M1 excitability. Immediately after the intervention, motor function of the affected upper limb improved in both groups (P {\textless} 0.005). One month after the intervention, the APBT group had better upper limb motor function than control patients (P {\textless} 0.05). The APBT group had increased ipsilesional M1 excitability (P {\textless} 0.025), increased transcallosal inhibition from ipsilesional to contralesional M1 (P {\textless} 0.01) and increased intracortical inhibition within contralesional M1 (P {\textless} 0.005). None of these changes were found in the control group. APBT produced sustained improvements in upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients and induced specific and sustained changes in motor cortex inhibitory function. We speculate that APBT may have facilitated plastic reorganization in the brain in response to motor therapy. The utility of APBT as an adjuvant to physical therapy warrants further consideration. {\textcopyright} The Author (2008). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.

abstract = {Globally, a large population is suffering from motor disabilities caused by acute lesions to brain nervous system. One example is stroke, which is the third largest killer in New Zealand and the United States. Traditional manual therapy usually requires cooperative and intensive efforts from therapists and patients. Robot-assisted upper-limb rehabilitation techniques have been actively researched in the past few decades. However, limitations still exist such as inappropriate robotic modelling, mechanical design or limited Range of Motion (ROM). This paper proposes a mathematical model for a 6-Degree of Freedom (DOF) Universal Robot to be used in a rehabilitation system. This study focuses on the kinematics and dynamic analysis by using the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters method with coordinate transformation theory. In order to simplify the computation process, Kane equation method is introduced in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed model is correct although the fluctuation is possible to be reduced further. It concludes that the mathematical model can provide an intuitive and effective environment for designing the rehabilitation robot and planning the clinical trials.},

This work aimed to design and develop a novel three-dimensional (3D) printable non-assembly five-fingered robotic hand exoskeleton for rehabilitation. A single degree-of-freedom (DOF) linkage was designed to actuate each finger with 3 output links that correspond to the three phalanxes of the human finger. We used a parametric modelling approach that suits the dimensions of individual's hand. The fabrication of this dynamic model was achieved by printing the complete assembly including all the driving links, output links, and joints. We manufactured a prototype and developed real-time actuation and control. The reported unique linkage design, combined with parametric modelling and 3D printing technology, will pave the way for mass customization of active assistive and resistive hand exoskeletons.},

abstract = {Current neuroscience has identified several constructs to increase the effectiveness of upper extremity rehabilitation. One is the use of progressive, skill acquisition-oriented training. Another approach emphasizes the use of bilateral activities. Building on these principles, this paper describes the design and feasibility testing of a robotic/virtual environment system designed to train the arm of persons who have had strokes. The system provides a variety of assistance modes, scalable workspaces and handrobot interfaces allowing persons with strokes to train multiple joints in three dimensions. The simulations utilize assistance algorithms that adjust task difficulty both online and offline in relation to subject performance. Several distinctive haptic effects have been incorporated into the simulations. An adaptive masterslave relationship between the unimpaired and impaired arm encourages active movement of the subject's hemiparetic arm during a bimanual task. Adaptive anti-gravity support and damping stabilize the arm during virtual reaching and placement tasks. An adaptive virtual spring provides assistance to complete the movement if the subject is unable to complete the task in time. Finally, haptically rendered virtual objects help to shape the movement trajectory during a virtual placement task. A proof of concept study demonstrated this system to be safe, feasible and worthy of further study. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recovery of upper and lower limbs function is essential to reach independence in daily activities in patients with upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS). Rehabilitation can provide a guide for motor recovery influencing the neurobiology of neuronal plasticity providing controlled, repetitive, and variable patterns. Increasing therapy dosage, intensity, number of repetition, execution of task-oriented exercises, and combining top-down and bottom-up approaches can promote plasticity and functional recovery. Robotic exoskeletons for upper and lower limbs, based on the principle of motor learning, have been introduced in neurorehabilitation. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of literature published on exoskeleton devices for upper and lower limb rehabilitation in patients with UMNS; we summarized the available current research evidence and outlined the new challenges that neurorehabilitation and bioengineering will have to face in the upcoming years. Robotic treatment should be considered a rehabilitation tool useful to generate a more complex, controlled multisensory stimulation of the patient and useful to modify the plasticity of neural connections through the experience of movement. Efficacy and efficiency of robotic treatment should be defined starting from intensity, complexity, and specificity of the robotic exercise, that are related to human-robot interaction in terms of motion, emotion, motivation, meaning of the task, feedback from the exoskeleton, and fine motion assistance. Duration of a single session, global period of the treatment, and the timing for beginning of robotic treatment are still open questions. There is the need to evaluate and individualize the treatment according to patient's characteristics. Robotic devices for upper and lower limbs open a window to define therapeutic modalities as possible beneficial drug, able to boost biological, neurobiological, and epigenetic changes in central nervous system. We need to implement large and innovative research programs to answer these issues in the near future.},

MIME incorporates a PUMA 560 robot (Staubli Unimation Inc, Duncan, South Carolina) that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and bilateral movements in three dimensions. Robot-assisted treatment (bilateral, unilateral, and combined bilateral and unilateral) was compared with conventional therapy. Similar to a previous study in chronic stroke, combined unilateral and bilateral robotic training had advantages compared with conventional therapy, producing larger improvements on a motor impairment scale and a measure of abnormal synergies. However, gains in all treatment groups were equivalent at the 6-month follow-up. Combined unilateral and bilateral training yielded functional gains that were similar to the gains from equivalent doses of unilateral-only robotic training, although the combined group had more hypertonia and less movement out of synergy at baseline. Robot-assisted treatment gains exceeded those expected from spontaneous recovery. These results are discussed in light of the need for further device development and continued clinical trials.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to document plastic changes in the functional topography of primary motor cortex (M1) that are generated in motor skill learning in the normal, intact primate. Intracortical microstimulation mapping techniques were used to derive detailed maps of the representation of movements in the distal forelimb zone of M1 of squirrel monkeys, before and after behavioral training on two different tasks that differentially encouraged specific sets of forelimb movements. After training on a small-object retrieval task, which required skilled use of the digits, their evoked-movement digit representations expanded, whereas their evoked-movement wrist/forearm representational zones contracted. These changes were progressive and reversible. In a second motor skill exercise, a monkey pronated and supinated the forearm in a key (eyebolt)-turning task. In this case, the representation of the forearm expanded, whereas the digit representational zones contracted. These results show that M1 is alterable by use throughout the life of an animal. These studies also revealed that after digit training there was an areal expansion of dual-response representations, that is, cortical sectors over which stimulation produced movements about two or more joints. Movement combinations that were used more frequently after training were selectively magnified in their cortical representations. This close correspondence between changes in behavioral performance and electrophysiologically defined motor representations indicates that a neurophysiological correlate of a motor skill resides in M1 for at least several days after acquisition. The finding that cocontracting muscles in the behavior come to be represented together in the cortex argues that, as in sensory cortices, temporal correlations drive emergent changes in distributed motor cortex representations.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of unilateral hybrid therapy (UHT) and bilateral hybrid therapy (BHT) compared with robot-assisted therapy (RT) alone in patients with chronic stroke. Design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Four hospitals. Participants: Outpatients with chronic stroke and mild to moderate motor impairment (N=44). Intervention: UHT combined unilateral RT (URT) and modified constraint-induced therapy. BHT combined bilateral RT (BRT) and bilateral arm training. The RT group received URT and BRT. The intervention frequency for the 3 groups was 90 min/d 3 d/wk for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA, divided into the proximal and distal subscale) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores before, immediately after, and 3 months after treatment and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale scores before and immediately after treatment. Results: The results favored BHT over UHT on the FMA total score and distal score at the posttest (P=.03 and .04) and follow-up (P=.01 and .047) assessment and BHT over RT on the follow-up FMA distal scores (P=.03). At the posttest assessment, the WMFT and SIS scores of the 3 groups improved significantly without between-group differences, and the RT group showed significantly greater improvement in the mobility domain of NEADL compared with the BHT group (P{\textless}.01). Conclusions: BHT was more effective for improving upper extremity motor function, particularly distal motor function at follow-up, and individuals in the RT group demonstrated improved functional ambulation post intervention.},

abstract = {Background: Robot-assisted rehabilitation is an advanced new technology in stroke rehabilitation to provide intensive training. Post-stroke motor recovery depends on active rehabilitation by voluntary participation of patient's paretic motor system as early as possible in order to promote reorganization of brain. However, voluntary residual motor efforts to the affected limb have not been involved enough in most robot-assisted rehabilitation for patients after stroke. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of robot-assisted rehabilitation using myoelectric control on upper limb motor recovery. Methods. In the present study, an exoskeleton-type rehabilitation robotic system was designed to provide voluntarily controlled assisted torque to the affected wrist. Voluntary intention was involved by using the residual surface electromyography (EMG) from flexor carpi radialis(FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR)on the affected limb to control the mechanical assistance provided by the robotic system during wrist flexion and extension in a 20-session training. The system also applied constant resistant torque to the affected wrist during the training. Sixteen subjects after stroke had been recruited for evaluating the tracking performance and therapeutical effects of myoelectrically controlled robotic system. Results: With the myoelectrically-controlled assistive torque, stroke survivors could reach a larger range of motion with a significant decrease in the EMG signal from the agonist muscles. The stroke survivors could be trained in the unreached range with their voluntary residual EMG on the paretic side. After 20-session rehabilitation training, there was a non-significant increase in the range of motion and a significant decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual wrist angle and target angle. Significant improvements also could be found in muscle strength and clinical scales. Conclusions: These results indicate that robot-aided therapy with voluntary participation of patient's paretic motor system using myoelectric control might have positive effect on upper limb motor recovery. {\textcopyright} 2013 Song et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The methodology employed is based upon the comparison of the measured data obtained from a FSR with the one obtained from a calibrated load cell. The force loading and unloading processes are performed automatically with a mechatronic device which allows having time invariant and variant force profiles. Special analysis is taken over creep and hysteresis compensation along with its relation with static and dynamic applications with the help of existing literature. At the end a time dependant function is obtained that relates the force applied on the sensor, and the signal obtained from it, allowing for the use on applications to measure force and pressure in ranges from 0 to 20N and 0 to 100mmHg respectively. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Many studies have proven that the building sector can significantly benefit from replacing the current practice rule-based controllers (RBC) by more advanced control strategies like model predictive control (MPC). However, the optimization-based control algorithms, like MPC, impose increasing hardware and software requirements, together with more complicated error handling capabilities required from the commissioning staff. In recent years, several studies introduced promising remedy for these problems by using machine learning algorithms. The idea is based on devising simplified control laws learned from MPC. The main advantage of the proposed methods stems from their easy implementation even on low-level hardware. However, most of the reported studies were dealing only with problems with a limited complexity of the parametric space, and devising laws only for a single control variable, which inevitably limits their applicability to more complex building control problems. In this paper, we introduce a versatile framework for synthesis of simple, yet well-performing control strategies that mimic the behavior of optimization-based controllers, also for large scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) control problems which are common in the building sector. The approach employs multivariate regression and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Particularly, deep time delay neural networks (TDNN) and regression trees (RT) are used to derive the dependency of multiple real-valued control inputs on parameters. The complexity of the problem, as well as implementation cost, are further reduced by selecting the most significant features from the set of parameters. This reduction is based on straightforward manual selection, principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic analysis of the building model. The approach is demonstrated on a case study employing temperature control in a six-zone building, described by a linear model with 286 states and 42 disturbances, resulting in an MPC problem with more than thousand of parameters. The results show that simplified control laws retain most of the performance of the complex MPC, while significantly decreasing the complexity and implementation cost.},

abstract = {A key approach for reducing motor impairment and regaining independence after stroke is frequent and repetitive functional training. A number of robotic devices have been developed to assist therapists with the labourious task of providing treatment. Although robotic technology is showing significant potential, its effectiveness for upper limb rehabilitation is limited in part by the inability to make functional reaching movements. A major contributor to this problem is that current robots do not replicate motion of the shoulder girdle despite the fact that the shoulder girdle plays a critical role in stabilizing and orienting the upper limb during activities of daily living. To address this issue, a new adjustable robotic exoskeleton called MEDARM is proposed for motor rehabilitation of the shoulder complex. MEDARM provides independent control of six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the upper limb: two at the sternoclavicular joint, three at the glenohumeral joint and one at the elbow. Its joint axes are optimally arranged to mimic the natural upper-limb workspace while avoiding singular configurations and while maximizing manipulability. This mechanism also permits reduction to planar shoulder/elbow motion in any plane by locking all but the last two joints. Electric motors actuate the joint using a combination of cable and belt transmissions designed to maximize the power-to-weight ratio of the robot while maintaining backdriveability and minimizing inertia. Thus, the robot can provide any level of movement assistance and gravity compensation. This paper describes the proposed technical design for MEDARM. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Bio-signal based assessment for upper-limb functions is an attractive technology for rehabilitation. In this work, an upper-limb function evaluator is developed based on biological signals, which could be used for selecting different robotic training protocols. Interaction force (IF) and participation level (PL, processed surface electromyography (sEMG) signals) are used as the key bio-signal inputs for the evaluator. Accordingly, a robot-based standardized performance testing (SPT) is developed to measure these key bio-signal data. Moreover, fuzzy logic is used to regulate biological signals, and a rules-based selector is then developed to select different training protocols. To the authors' knowledge, studies focused on biological signal-based evaluator for selecting robotic training protocols, especially for robot-based bilateral rehabilitation, has not yet been reported in literature. The implementation of SPT and fuzzy logic to measure and process key bio-signal data with a rehabilitation robot system is the first of its kind. Five healthy participants were then recruited to test the performance of the SPT, fuzzy logic and evaluator in three different conditions (tasks). The results show: (1) the developed SPT has an ability to measure precise bio-signal data from participants; (2) the utilized fuzzy logic has an ability to process the measured data with the accuracy of 86.7{\%} and 100{\%} for the IF and PL respectively; and (3) the proposed evaluator has an ability to distinguish the intensity of biological signals and thus to select different robotic training protocols. The results from the proposed evaluator, and biological signals measured from healthy people could also be used to standardize the criteria to assess the results of stroke patients later.},

abstract = {This paper presents the control system design of a rehabilitation and training robot for the upper limbs. Based on a hierarchical structure, this control system allows the execution of sequence of switching control laws (position, force, impedance and force/impedance) corresponding to the required training configuration. A model-based nonlinear controller is used to impose the desired environment to the patient's arm. The knowledge of robot kinematics and dynamics is thus necessary to ensure haptic transparency and patient safety. The identification process of robot dynamics is emphasised and experimental identification results are given for the designed robot. The paper also presents a particular rehabilitation mode named Active-Assisted. Simulation results of this rehabilitation mode illustrate the potentialities of the overall control scheme, which can also be applied to other rehabilitation robots. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

@article{Han2008,
abstract = {Motor training with the upper limb affected by stroke partially reverses the loss of cortical representation after lesion and has been proposed to increase spontaneous arm use. Moreover, repeated attempts to use the affected hand in daily activities create a form of practice that can potentially lead to further improvement in motor performance. We thus hypothesized that if motor retraining after stroke increases spontaneous arm use sufficiently, then the patient will enter a virtuous circle in which spontaneous arm use and motor performance reinforce each other. In contrast, if the dose of therapy is not sufficient to bring spontaneous use above threshold, then performance will not increase and the patient will further develop compensatory strategies with the less affected hand. To refine this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of bilateral hand use in arm reaching to study the interactions between adaptive decision making and motor relearning after motor cortex lesion. The model contains a left and a right motor cortex, each controlling the opposite arm, and a single action choice module. The action choice module learns, via reinforcement learning, the value of using each arm for reaching in specific directions. Each motor cortex uses a neural population code to specify the initial direction along which the contralateral hand moves towards a target. The motor cortex learns to minimize directional errors and to maximize neuronal activity for each movement. The derived learning rule accounts for the reversal of the loss of cortical representation after rehabilitation and the increase of this loss after stroke with insufficient rehabilitation. Further, our model exhibits nonlinear and bistable behavior: if natural recovery, motor training, or both, brings performance above a certain threshold, then training can be stopped, as the repeated spontaneous arm use provides a form of motor learning that further bootstraps performance and spontaneous use. Below this threshold, motor training is "in vain": there is little spontaneous arm use after training, the model exhibits learned nonuse, and compensatory movements with the less affected hand are reinforced. By exploring the nonlinear dynamics of stroke recovery using a biologically plausible neural model that accounts for reversal of the loss of motor cortex representation following rehabilitation or the lack thereof, respectively, we can explain previously hard to reconcile data on spontaneous arm use in stroke recovery. Further, our threshold prediction could be tested with an adaptive train-wait-train paradigm: if spontaneous arm use has increased in the "wait" period, then the threshold has been reached, and rehabilitation can be stopped. If spontaneous arm use is still low or has decreased, then another bout of rehabilitation is to be provided. {\textcopyright} 2008 Han et al.},

abstract = {Introduction: Robots help to intensify motor rehabilitation of the upper and lower limbs after stroke. This article presents controlled studies relating to this topic, and an overview. Methods: A search was carried out for relevant randomized controlled trials, published between 1980 and 2007, on Medline (PubMed), Embase, and CINHAL. Results: Two studies showed benefit for an electromechanical gait trainer, with significantly more patients resuming walking as compared to conventional physiotherapy. Two studies showed no evidence of benefit for an exoskeleton-based system. A pooled analysis was not conducted due to the small numbers of studies and high heterogeneity. In arm/hand rehabilitation a number of unilateral or bilateral end-effector based systems proved effective in patients with stroke, and a simple one-dimensional system and a passive exoskeleton system proved effective in patients with chronic symptoms. Discussion: Robot-assisted motor rehabilitation after stroke appears promising. More trials, including comparative studies, are mandatory. The robot cannot be considered a substitute for the patient-therapist relationship.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using rehabilitation robots to assist post-stroke patients during rehabilitation therapy. The motion control of the robot plays an important role in the process of functional recovery training. Due to the change of the arm impedance of the post-stroke patient in the passive recovery training, the conventional motion control based on a proportional-integral (PI) controller is difficult to produce smooth movement of the robot to track the designed trajectory set by the rehabilitation therapist. In this paper, we model the dynamics of post-stroke patient arm as an impedance model, and propose an adaptive control scheme, which consists of an adaptive PI control algorithm and an adaptive damping control algorithm, to control the rehabilitation robot moving along predefined trajectories stably and smoothly. An equivalent two-port circuit of the rehabilitation robot and human arm is built, and the passivity theory of circuits is used to analyze the stability and smoothness performance of the robot. A slide Least Mean Square with adaptive window (SLMS-AW) method is presented for on-line estimation of the parameters of the arm impedance model, which is used for adjusting the gains of the PI-damping controller. In this paper, the Barrett WAM Arm manipulator is used as the main hardware platform for the functional recovery training of the post-stroke patient. Passive recovery training has been implemented on the WAM Arm, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed adaptive control strategies.},

The intent of the Variable Camber Compliant Wing was to demonstrate an active 2D section camber change under aerodynamic load. Mounting possibilities were limited in the Vertical Wind Tunnel due to the dimensions and weight of the wing which necessitated a custom design to obtain aerodynamic force measurements. ATI Industrial Automation offers a promising solution with their wide range of multi-axis force/torque sensors which are becoming widely adopted in aerodynamic testing of small unmanned aircraft. These sensors can provide accurate results when loaded in close proximity to the balance center. However, it has been reported in literature that the error increases dramatically when loaded off the balance center. In this case, a load cell is mounted on each end of the unique fixture, forming a direct interaction between the two load cells. An extensive calibration loading procedure was performed prior to the test to develop a calibration matrix sensitive to the test setup. The intent of this paper is to present development of a correction method for this unique mounting fixture which could provide a new flexible wing testing capability in the Vertical Wind Tunnel Facility at the Air Force Research Laboratory.},

An affordable bilateral assessment system (BiAS) consisting of two mini-passive measuring units modeled as three degree of freedom robots is described. The process for evaluating functional tasks using the BiAS is presented and we demonstrate its ability to measure wrist kinematic trajectories. Three metrics, phase difference, movement overlap, and task completion time, are used to evaluate the BiAS system on a bilateral symmetric (bi-drink) and a bilateral asymmetric (bi-pour) functional task. Wrist position and velocity trajectories are evaluated using these metrics to provide insight into temporal and spatial bilateral deficits after stroke. The BiAS system quantified movements of the wrists during functional tasks and detected differences in impaired and unimpaired arm movements. Case studies showed that stroke patients compared to healthy subjects move slower and are less likely to use their arm simultaneously even when the functional task requires simultaneous movement. After robot-assisted therapy, interlimb coordination spatial deficits moved toward normal coordination on functional tasks. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {Objective: In patients with stroke, the authors tested whether additional sensorimotor training of the paralyzed or paretic upper limb delivered by a robotic device enhanced motor outcome. Methods: Fifty-six patients with stroke and hemiparesis or hemiplegia received standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation, and were randomly assigned either to receive robotic training (at least 25 hours) or exposure to the robotic device without training. Outcomes were assessed by the same masked raters, before treatment began and at the end of treatment, with the upper extremity component of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, the Motor Status score, the Motor Power score, and Functional Independence Measurement. Result: The robot treatment and control group had comparable clinical characteristics, lesion size, and pretreatment impairment scores. By the end of treatment, the robot-trained group demonstrated improvement in motor outcome for the trained shoulder and elbow (Motor Power score, p {\textless} 0.001; Motor Status score, p {\textless} 0.01) that did not generalize to untrained wrist and hand. The robot-treated group also demonstrated significantly improved- functional outcome (Functional Independence Measurement-Motor, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: Robot-delivered quantitative and reproducible sensorimotor training enhanced the motor performance of the exercised shoulder and elbow. The robot-treated group also demonstrated improved functional outcome.

abstract = {Background - There is little consistency in the measurement of outcome in acute stroke trials, and this may complicate interpretation of the results and reduce the likelihood of detecting worthwhile drug effects. This study aims to investigate empirically the measures used to date and to give recommendations for future studies. Summary of Comment A systematic review of all published randomized studies of acute stroke drug intervention was undertaken, and the measures used were recorded. Fifty-one studies involving 57 214 subjects were identified. These studies used 14 different measures of impairment, 11 different measures of activity, 1 measure of 'quality of life,' and 8 miscellaneous other measures. Timing of outcome assessments varied from 1 week to 1 year, with the modal time being 3 months. Many studies used ordinal measures but dichotomized results for analysis. Of the 51 studies included in the review, only 21 demonstrated benefit with the defined primary outcome measure. In several studies, however, post hoc analysis using varied outcome measures or varied cut points for dichotomizing outcomes resulted in positive results, whereas the primary study analysis failed to do so. Conclusions - There is no consensus on the level of outcome to be used, the method of measurement to be used, or the most appropriate timing of the assessment. It is recommended that future studies should include extended/instrumental activities and advanced mobility as components of the primary outcome measure, with outcome assessment being undertaken at 6 months. New initiatives in developing stroke-specific outcomes may address some of the current problems in the assessment of stroke outcomes.},

The stiffening nature of the load cell causes its deflection and strain to be very sensitive to small forces and less sensitive to large forces. High stiffness at high forces prevents the load cell from over-straining. We physically implement the nonlinear springs with cantilever beams that increasingly contact rigid surfaces with carefully chosen curvatures as more force is applied. We analytically describe the performance of the load cell as a function of its geometric and material parameters. We also describe a method for manufacturing the mechanical component of the load cell out of one monolithic part, which decreases hysteresis and assembly costs.

abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

abstract = {Introduction: Robot-assisted therapy for upper limb rehabilitation is an emerging research topic and its design process must integrate engineering, neurological pathophysiology, and clinical needs. Purpose of the study: This study developed/evaluated the usefulness of a novel rehabilitation device, the MirrorPath, designed for the upper limb rehabilitation of patients with hemiplegic stroke. Methods: The process follows Tseng's methodology for innovative product design and development, namely two stages, device development and usability assessment. During the development process, the design was guided by patients' rehabilitation needs as defined by patients and their therapists. The design applied synchronic movement of the bilateral upper limbs, an approach that is compatible with the bilateral movement therapy and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation theories. MirrorPath consists of a robotic device that guides upper limb movement linked to a control module containing software controlling the robotic movement. Results: Five healthy subjects were recruited in the pretest, and 4 patients, 4 caregivers, and 4 therapists were recruited in the formal test for usability. All recruited subjects were allocated to the test group, completed the evaluation, and their data were all analyzed. The total system usability scale score obtained from the patients, caregivers, and therapists was 71.8 ± 11.9, indicating a high level of usability and product acceptance. Discussion and conclusion: Following a standard development process, we could yield a design that meets clinical needs. This low-cost device provides a feasible platform for carrying out robot-assisted bilateral movement therapy of patients with hemiplegic stroke.},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to design a robot control system for assisting in the rehabilitation of patients who suffer from debilitating illness such as stroke. The rehabilitation robot discussed in this subject is able to guide patient's wrist to move along planned trajectory in both horizontal and vertical plane, and train the elbow joint as well as shoulder joint. Increasingly the robot requires interacting directly with human, so it needs to control not only the robot position but also the applied forces. In this paper, it presents a new position-based impedance control that involves a combined force feedback and position control. At the meantime, it gives a conversion relationship between the commands of force and position. A new controller structure is proposed, which consists of an outer force controller enhanced by impedance control. The target impedance model modifies a desired trajectory according to the force signals. The modified trajectory acts as a compensate resource adding to the desired trajectory. Then the robot tracks the trajectory using the inner position controller. The experiment results show that the trajectory tracking based on force feedback on the condition of realizing the target impedance is feasible, and it can achieve better training effect by chosen different impedance parameters in the light of patient's illness. {\textcopyright}2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background: Infants during neonatal intensive care are invariably exposed to various procedural and environmental stimuli in which the pain-like responses may vary depending on the nature of the stimuli and the infants' condition. Aim: To examine firstly the pain-like responses to frequent stimulants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using CRIES, FLACC and PIPP, and secondly the clinical feasibility and validity of using these pain measurements for high-risk infants. Study design and subjects: In a correlational study of 110 premature infants receiving neonatal intensive care, the pain-like responses to 274 observations of 8 types of frequently applied stimulant, classified into three categories according to the degree of invasiveness, were observed using CRIES, FLACC and PIPP. Results: There was a significant difference in response scores among the three categories for CRIES and PIPP. In post-hoc Scheff{\'{e}} test, category A had the highest response scores. The response scores from CRIES and FLACC were lower for the premature infants than for the full-term infants in both categories A and B, whereas the PIPP scores were higher for the premature infants than for the term infants in category C. Conclusions: Full-term infants tended to express more distinct pain-like responses to invasive procedures or direct contacts than premature infants did. However, PIPP may be more sensitive to evaluate the negative effects of environmental auditory stimulants, particularly for premature infants receiving neonatal intensive care. Further study to refine these instruments may increase the clinical feasibility of pain measurements in high-risk infants. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stroke interferes with voluntary control of motor actions. Although spontaneous recovery of function can occur, restoration of normal motor function in the hemiplegic upper limb is noted in fewer than 15{\%} of individuals. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that in addition to injury-related reorganization, motor cortex functions can be altered by individual motor experiences. Such neural plasticity has major implications for the type of rehabilitative training administered post-stroke. This review proposes that noteworthy upper extremity gains toward motor recovery evolve from activity-dependent intervention based on theoretical motor control constructs and interlimb coordination principles. Founded on behavioral and neurophysiological mechanisms, bilateral movement training/practice has shown great promise in expediting progress toward chronic stroke recovery in the upper extremity. Planning and executing bilateral movements post-stroke may facilitate cortical neural plasticity by three mechanisms: (a) motor cortex disinhibition that allows increased use of the spared pathways of the damaged hemisphere, (b) increased recruitment of the ipsilateral pathways from the contralesional or contralateral hemisphere to supplement the damaged crossed corticospinal pathways, and (c) upregulation of descending premotorneuron commands onto propriospinal neurons. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have the potential to promote cortical plasticity following stroke, which has been shown to improve motor recovery outcomes. However, clinical efficacy of BMI-enabled robotic rehabilitation in chronic stroke population is confounded by the spectrum of motor impairments caused by stroke. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of neurorehabilitation therapy on upper-limb motor recovery, by quantifying changes in clinical, BMI-based, and kinematics-based metrics. Further, to identify neural correlates or biomarkers that can predict the extent of motor recovery. Methods: Chronic stroke survivors (n = 10, age 55 ± 9.2y, chronicity 3.1 ± 2.8y) were recruited to participate in a 4-6 weeks long clinical study. Participants completed 12 therapy sessions that involved a BMI enabled powered exoskeleton (MAHI Exo-II) for training, which targeted elbow flexion and extension. Clinical assessments including Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) were measured up to 2-months after therapy. BMI performance, kinematic performance, and change in movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) were also determined. Results: On average, 132 ± 22 repetitions were performed per participant, per session. BMI accuracy across all sessions and subjects was 79 ± 18{\%}, with a small number of false positives (23 ± 20{\%}). FMA-UE and ARAT scores improved significantly over baseline after therapy and were retained at follow-ups ($\Delta$FMA-UE = 3.92 ± 3.73 and $\Delta$ARAT = 5.35 ± 4.62, p {\textless} 0.05). 80{\%} participants (7 with moderate-mild impairment and 1 with severe-moderate impairment) reached minimal clinically important difference (MCID: FMA-UE {\textgreater} 5.2 or ARAT {\textgreater} 5.7) during the course of the study. Kinematic measures indicate that, on average, participants' movements became faster and smoother. Quantification of changes in MRCP amplitude showed significant correlation with ARAT scores ($\rho$ = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.05) and marginally significant correlation with FMA-UE ($\rho$ = 0.63, p = 0.051), suggesting higher activation of ipsi-lesional hemisphere post-intervention. The study did not have any adverse events. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that BMI enabled robotic rehabilitation can promote motor recovery in individuals with chronic stroke, several years after injury and irrespective of their impairment level, or location of the lesion (cortical/subcortical) at baseline. Further, the extent of motor recovery was correlated with changes in movement related potentials, occurring contralateral to the impaired arm.

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of disability among adults in the United States. Behaviors such as learned nonuse hinder hemiplegic stroke survivors from the full use of both arms in activities of daily living. Active force-feedback cues, designed to restrain the use of the less-affected arm, were embedded into a meaningful driving simulation environment to create robot-assisted therapy device, driver's simulation environment for arm therapy (SEAT). The study hypothesized that force-feedback control mode could "motivate" stroke survivors to increase the productive use of their impaired arm throughout a bilateral steering task, by providing motivating feedback and reinforcement cues to reduce the overuse of the less-affected arm. Experimental results demonstrate that the force cues counteracted the tendency of hemiplegic subjects to produce counter-productive torques only during bilateral steering tasks (p {\textless} 0.05) that required the movement of their impaired arm in steering directions up and against gravity. Impaired arm activity was quantified in terms of torques due to the measured tangential forces on the split-steering wheel of driver's SEAT during bilateral steering. Results were verified using surface electromyograms recorded from key muscles in the impaired arm. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background Visual field defects after posterior cerebral artery stroke can be improved by vision restoration training (VRT), but when combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which alters brain excitability, vision recovery can be potentiated in the chronic stage. To date, the combination of VRT and tDCS has not been evaluated in postacute stroke rehabilitation. Objectives To determine whether combined tDCS and VRT can be effectively implemented in the early recovery phase following stroke, and to explore the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an early intervention. Design Open-label pilot study including a case series of 7 tDCS/VRT versus a convenience sample of 7 control patients (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02935413). Setting Rehabilitation center. Subjects Patients with homonymous visual field defects following a posterior cerebral artery stroke. Methods Seven homonymous hemianopia patients were prospectively treated with 10 sessions of combined tDCS (2.mA, 10 daily sessions of 20 minutes) and VRT at 66 (±50) days on average poststroke. Visual field recovery was compared with the retrospective data of 7 controls, whose defect sizes and age of lesions were matched to those of the experimental subjects and who had received standard rehabilitation with compensatory eye movement and exploration training. Results All 7 patients in the treatment group completed the treatment protocol. The safety and acceptance were excellent, and patients reported occasional skin itching beneath the electrodes as the only minor side effect. Irrespective of their treatment, both groups (treatment and control) showed improved visual fields as documented by an increased mean sensitivity threshold in decibels in standard static perimetry. Recovery was significantly greater (P {\textless}.05) in the tDCS/VRT patients (36.73{\%} ± 37.0{\%}) than in the controls (10.74{\%} ± 8.86{\%}). Conclusion In this open-label pilot study, tDCS/VRT in subacute stroke was demonstrated to be safe, with excellent applicability and acceptance of the treatment. Preliminary effectiveness calculations show that tDCS/VRT may be superior to standard vision training procedures. A confirmatory, larger-sample, controlled, randomized, and double-blind trial is now underway to compare real-tDCS− versus sham-tDCS−supported visual field training in the early vision rehabilitation phase.

This is due to neuroplasticity – the ability of the brain to change through adulthood. Various rehabilitation processes have been developed to take advantage of neuroplasticity to retrain neural pathways and restore or improve motor skills lost as a result of stroke or spinal cord injuries (SCI). Research in this area over the last few decades has resulted in a better understanding of the dynamics of rehabilitation in post-stroke patients and development of auxiliary devices and tools to induce repeated targeted body movements. With the growing number of stroke rehabilitation therapies, the application of robotics within the rehabilitation process has received much attention. As such, numerous mechanical and robot-assisted upper limb and hand function training devices have been proposed. A systematic review of robotic-assisted upper extremity (UE) motion rehabilitation therapies was carried out in this study. The strengths and limitations of each method and its effectiveness in arm and hand function recovery were evaluated. The study provides a comparative analysis of the latest developments and trends in this field, and assists in identifying research gaps and potential future work.},

abstract = {The recovery of coordinated motor function after stroke onset has been associated with the practice of upper limb movements that required the activation of homologous muscles. This pilot study investigated whether repetitive bimanual coordinated movements enhanced upper limb corticomotor (CM) excitability and motor function poststroke. Patients practiced driving their paretic wrist through passive rhythmical flexion-extension by active flexion-extension of their unaffected wrist using purpose-built manipulanda over a 4-week period. Both preintervention and postintervention motricity was assessed using the upper limb Fugl-Meyer rating scale, and cortical maps of wrist flexor and extensor representations were derived from potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Five of nine subjects improved upper limb motricity in response to this novel active-passive bimanual movement therapy (APBT). Unaffected cortical map volume decreased, especially for a subgroup of five patients who had a postintervention increase in motricity. No change in unaffected map volume was revealed for the four patients who did not improve their postintervention motricity. No consistent shifts in cortical map center of gravity were revealed. These findings suggest that APBT can initiate an improvement in motricity that is accompanied by a balancing of between-hemisphere CM excitability. The findings justify the assessment of the rehabilitative effects of APBT in a homogeneous sample of patients poststroke.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted cooperative rehabilitation training has shown superiority in helping the individuals with motion impairment problems to regain their motor functions. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a new cooperative training control scheme for an end-effector-type rehabilitation robot to provide upper extremity rehabilitation training with desired compliance and intensity. Firstly, the overall mechanical structure and real-time control system of rehabilitation robot are introduced. Secondly, an integral fuzzy sliding mode impedance control strategy combined with time-delay estimation (IFSMIC-TDE) is proposed to induce the active participation of patients and suppress impedance error. The IFSMIC-TDE approach is free from nonlinear robot dynamics, and it is designed to be robust to the external uncertainties and inherent chattering characteristics. After that, the closed-loop system stability with IFSMIC-TDE is proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, experimental investigations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rehabilitation robot and control algorithm. The comparison results indicate that the proposed IFSMIC-TDE can achieve better control performance and less impedance error. Besides, the interaction compliance and training intensity can be qualitatively adjusted via appropriate impedance parameters.},

There is evidence to support rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however, information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce.

It can be used without dismantling the sensor from its application and requires a smaller number of standard loads for calibration. It is also cheaper and faster method in comparison with traditional calibration methods. The method was developed in response to re-calibration issues with the force sensor used in the welding/machining robot of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) vacuum vessel (VV) and the approach aimed to avoid dismantling and on-site assembly of components of the ITER robot. A major complication with the ITER robot is difficult to access the robot when it operates inside the VV; especially after the first plasma, which will make the vessel radioactive. The proposed technique is based on the design of experiment methodology. It has been successfully applied to different force/torque sensors and this paper presents experimental results for the use of the calibration method with the force sensor that would be used on the ITER robot. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This tendency of under utilizing the impaired arm slows down the re-acquisition of bilateral coordination on activities of daily living. We wanted to examine whether this behavior could be studied and quantified using the TheraDrive system, a low-cost, mechatronic/robotic stroke rehabilitation system which uses a commercial force-feedback steering wheel along with custom games and unilateral and bilateral steering tasks for therapy and assessment. We attempt to quantify the role of the impaired arm in bilateral tracking with one and two-wheeled modes of the TheraDrive.

abstract = {Robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation has become popular as one approach to helping patients recover function post-stroke. Robotic rehabilitation requires four important elements to match the robot to the patient: realistic biomechanical robotic elements, an assistive control scheme enabled through the human-robot interface, a task oriented rehabilitation program based on the principles of plasticity, and objective assessment tools to monitor change. This paper reports on a randomized clinical trial utilizing a complete robot-assisted rehabilitation system for the recovery of upper limb function in patients post-stroke. In this study, a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) upper limb exoskeleton robot (UL-EXO7) is applied in a rehabilitation clinical trial for patients stable post-stroke (greater than six months). Patients had a Fugl-Meyer Score between 16-39, were mentally alert ({\textgreater}19 on the VA Mini Mental Status Exam) and were between 27 and 70 years of age. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: bilateral robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and usual care. This study is concerned with the changes in kinematics in the two robotic groups. Both patient groups played eight therapeutic video games over 12 sessions (90 min, two times a week). In each session, patients intensively played the different combination of video games that directly interacted with UL-EXO7 under the supervision of research assistant. At each session, all of the joint angle data was recorded for the evaluation of therapeutic effects. A new assessment metric is reported along with conventional metrics. The experimental result shows that both groups of patients showed consistent improvement with respect to the proposed and conventional metrics. {\textcopyright} 2001-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background. Current neuroscience has identified rehabilitation approaches with the potential to stimulate adaptive changes in the brains of persons with hemiparesis. These approaches include, intensive task-oriented training, bimanual activities and balancing proximal and distal upper extremity interventions to reduce competition between these segments for neural territory. Methods. This paper describes the design and feasibility testing of a robotic/virtual environment system designed to train the hand and arm of persons with hemiparesis. The system employs a simulated piano that presents visual, auditory and tactile feedback comparable to an actual piano. Arm tracking allows patients to train both the arm and hand as a coordinated unit, emphasizing the integration of both transport and manipulation phases. The piano trainer includes songs and scales that can be performed with one or both hands. Adaptable haptic assistance is available for more involved subjects. An algorithm adjusts task difficulty in proportion to subject performance. A proof of concept study was performed on four subjects with upper extremity hemiparesis secondary to chronic stroke to establish: a) the safety and feasibility of this system and b) the concurrent validity of robotically measured kinematic and performance measures to behavioral measures of upper extremity function. Results. None of the subjects experienced adverse events or responses during or after training. As a group, the subjects improved in both performance time and key press accuracy. Three of the four subjects demonstrated improvements in fractionation, the ability to move each finger individually. Two subjects improved their aggregate time on the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and three of the four subjects improved in Wolf Motor Function Test aggregate time. Conclusion. The system designed in this paper has proven to be safe and feasible for the training of hand function for persons with hemiparesis. It features a flexible design that allows for the use and further study of adjustments in point of view, bilateral and unimanual treatment modes, adaptive training algorithms and haptically rendered collisions in the context of rehabilitation of the hemiparetic hand. {\textcopyright} 2009 Adamovich et al.},

In this paper, a novel exoskeleton hand robot which was driven by cable has been proposed to aim at helping varieties of paralyses patients recover motor function. This exoskeleton hand rehabilitation robot system mainly consists of exoskeleton hand robot, EEG system, motor controllers unit, some sensors and a workstation. And the hand exoskeleton mechanism was portable, wearable and adjustable for patients doing home rehabilitation training. Based on the parameters from human hand, the kinematic model of hand robot was established to be used in designing and the kinematic simulation experiments about this exoskeleton hand robot were done. Through the simulation software ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems), the parameters of position, angle velocity and angle accelerated velocity (PVA) of proximate inter-phalanger (DIP) distal inter-phalanger joint were simulated. And then, the movement situation of the DIP joint was obtained according to the data from the position encoder. So the velocity curve and accelerated velocity curve were obtained by calculating the actual position function derivation. The simulated results showed that this exoskeleton hand robot has high movement ability to finish the continuous passive motion (CPM). Beside that, a comparison test was done to verify whether there were some motion blocks in wearing exoskeleton robot. Through analyzing the experimental data, the error between the actual position and the simulated position of the PIP joint of the finger was very small which verified the small interference of robot. These experiments demonstrated that the exoskeleton hand robot has high efficiency movement ability for stroke patients who need to do the finger rehabilitation training. In the future, the optimization design of the exoskeleton hand robot will be done in order to improve more movement ability.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-The diversity of available outcome measures for acute stroke trials is challenging and implies that the scales may be imperfect. To assist researchers planning trials and to aid interpretation, this article reviews and makes recommendations on the available choices of scales. The aim is to identify an approach that will be universally accepted and that should be included in most acute trials, without seeking to restrict options for special circumstances. Methods-The article considers outcome measures that have been widely used or are currently advised. It examines desirable properties for outcome measures such as validity, relevance, responsiveness, statistical properties, availability of training, cultural and language issues, resistance to comorbidity, as well as potential weaknesses. Tracking and agreement among outcomes are covered. Results-Typical ranges of scores for the common scales are described, along with their statistical properties, which in turn influence optimal analytic techniques. The timing of recovery on scores and usual practice in trial design are considered. Conclusions-The preferred outcome measure for acute trials is the modified Rankin Scale, assessed at 3 months after stroke onset or later. The interview should be conducted by a certified rater and should involve both the patient and any relevant caregiver. Incremental benefits at any level of the modified Rankin Scale may be acceptable. The modified Rankin Scale is imperfect but should be retained in its present form for comparability with existing treatment comparisons. No second measure should be required, but correlations with supporting scales may be used to confirm consistency in direction of effects on other measures. {\textcopyright} 2012 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.},

We tested a modified form of BATRAC (modBATRAC) in a new group of participants with a condensed treatment regime to determine whether we could replicate these reported results. Methods. Fourteen subjects with chronic stroke completed 2 weeks of 2.25 hours per session, 4 sessions per week of modBATRAC. Results. No significant changes were observed in UE Fugl-Meyer or Wolf Motor Function Test scores. Subjects did report increased paretic UE use on the Motor Activity Log (mean change, 0.50; SD = 0.70). Conclusions. The results of this study offer only partial support for the efficacy of modBATRAC. As in previous trials, modBATRAC facilitated increased use of the paretic arm, but unlike previous trials, it did not increase motor performance. These differences may reflect a more temporally condensed training schedule and less impaired patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

abstract = {The use of activity-dependent interventions has shown some success in promoting recovery of upper limb function in chronic stroke patients. This study compared the neurophysiological and behavioural changes associated with two such rehabilitation protocols: unilateral and bilateral movement training. Twelve chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to the two training protocols involving six daily practice sessions. Each session consisted of 50 trials of a dowel placement task performed either with both impaired and unimpaired arm moving synchronously (bilateral training group) or with only the impaired arm moving (unilateral training). Kinematic measurements of upper limb movements were made in four unilateral test trials performed prior to and following each practice session. Functional assessments of the impaired upper limb and neurophysiological assessments, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), of the affected and non-affected cortical hemispheres were made prior to and following the intervention sessions. Individuals receiving bilateral training showed a reduction in movement time of the impaired limb and increased upper limb functional ability compared to individuals receiving unilateral training. In some patients changes to upper limb function were associated with changes to the cortical representation of a target muscle in the non-affected hemisphere. Overall, these findings suggest that a short-term bilateral training intervention may be effective in facilitating upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Objective: To determine the role of anticipatory and movement control processes for the coordination of bimanual target aiming in individuals post stroke. Subjects: Thirty adults with chronic stroke and 30 individuals without stroke history. Design: A two-group (stroke, control) by two-aiming type (unimanual, bimanual) by two-limb (paretic, nonparetic; left, right for controls) design with repeated measures on the last two factors. Outcome measures: Kinematic analyses of performance and psychometric measures of reaction time, movement time, peak resultant velocity, time to and after peak resultant velocity and interlimb timing for movement initiation and target impact. Results: Compared with unimanual aiming, the nonparetic limb exhibited a prolonged movement time in the bimanual condition; the locus for prolongation was primarily in the deceleration phase. This adaptive response allowed for a nearly simultaneous (both limbs) target impact in 81{\%} of trials. Compared with the unimanual condition, the nonparetic limb exhibited a lower peak velocity (10{\%}) in the bimanual condition. Conversely, compared with the unimanual condition, the paretic limb exhibited a higher peak velocity (4{\%}) in the bimanual condition. This disociation between limb and condition was observed for the stroke group but not the control group. Conclusions: The interlimb coordination that emerged for the stroke group revealed a complex and asymmetric contribution from each limb mediated through anticipatory and motor control processes. We suggest that this coordination may be harnessed for future bimanual intervention approaches to rehabilitation of upper limb function after stroke. {\textcopyright} 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of adult motor disability. Despite recent progress, recovery of motor function after stroke is usually incomplete. This double blind, Sham-controlled, crossover study was designed to test the hypothesis that non-invasive stimulation of the motor cortex could improve motor function in the paretic hand of patients with chronic stroke. Hand function was measured using the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), a widely used, well validated test for functional motor assessment that reflects activities of daily living. JTT measured in the paretic hand improved significantly with non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), but not with Sham, an effect that outlasted the stimulation period, was present in every single patient tested and that correlated with an increment in motor cortical excitability within the affected hemisphere, expressed as increased recruitment curves (RC) and reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition. These results document a beneficial effect of non-invasive cortical stimulation on a set of hand functions that mimic activities of daily living in the paretic hand of patients with chronic stroke, and suggest that this interventional strategy in combination with customary rehabilitative treatments may play an adjuvant role in neurorehabilitation.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of an arm training programme combining repetition of unilateral and symmetrical bilateral tasks for people in the subacute phase after stroke. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Inpatient functional rehabilitation unit. Subjects: Forty-one people who had had a stroke, in the subacute phase, receiving conventional arm occupational and physical therapy, were randomized to an experimental group (n = 20) and a control group (n = 21). Interventions: In addition to the usual arm therapy in the rehabilitation unit, the experimental group received an arm therapy programme (15-20 45-min sessions) based on repetition of unilateral and symmetrical bilateral tasks. The control group received additional usual arm therapy of a similar duration and frequency to the experimental treatment. Main measures: The effect of the programme was judged on the basis of: (1) arm impairments (motor function, grip strength, gross and fine manual dexterity and motor co-ordination), (2) arm disabilities in tasks related to daily activities, and (3) functional independence in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Results: Although both experimental and control groups of participants improved similarly during the study period, the statistical analyses did not show any difference between the groups at the end of the treatment for the different dependent variables evaluated: (1) arm impairments: p = 0.43-0.79; (2) arm disabilities: p = 0.16-0.90; and (3) functional independence: p = 0.63 and 0.90. Conclusions: An arm training programme based on repetition of unilateral and symmetrical bilateral practice did not reduce impairment and disabilities nor improve functional outcomes in the subacute phase after stroke more than the usual therapy. {\textcopyright} 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

This paper summarizes the development and clinical testing of three mechatronic systems for post-stroke therapy conducted at the VA Palo Alto in collaboration with Stanford University. We describe the philosophy and experiences that guided their evolution. Unique to the Palo Alto approach is provision for bimanual, mirror-image, patient-controlled therapeutic exercise. Proof-of-concept was established with a 2-degree-of-freedom (DOF) elbow/forearm manipulator. Tests of a second-generation therapy robot producing planar forearm movements in 19 hemiplegic and control subjects confirmed the validity and reliability of interaction forces during mechanically assisted upper-limb movements. Clinical trials comparing 3-D robot-assisted therapy to traditional therapy in 21 chronic stroke subjects showed significant improvement in the Fugl-Meyer (FM) measure of motor recovery in the robot group, which exceeded improvements in the control group.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: The successful motor rehabilitation of stroke, traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients requires an intensive and task-specific therapy approach. Budget constraints limit a hand-to-hand therapy approach, so that intelligent machines may offer a solution to promote motor recovery and obtain a better understanding of motor control. This new field of automated or robot-assisted motor rehabilitation has emerged since the 1990s. Recent findings: This article will present clinically viable devices for upper and lower extremity rehabilitation. The MIT-Manus and the Mirror-Image Motion Enabler robot, which enable unrestricted unilateral or bilateral shoulder and elbow movement, consistently proved superior on the motor impairment level. The ARM guide, which assisted reaching in a straight-line trajectory, and the Bi-Manu-Track, which enabled the bilateral practice of a forearm and wrist movement, are currently being tested. For gait rehabilitation after stroke, the electromechanical gait trainer, GT I, has proved effective compared with treadmill training with body weight support. The Lokomat, consisting of a treadmill and a powered exoskeleton, lessened the therapeutic effort compared with manually assisted treadmill training in spinal cord-injured patients. Future developments will see more degrees of freedom, improved man-machine interaction and the implementation of virtual reality. Summary: Technical possibilities are one aspect, but multi-centre trials and a consideration of the unsubstantiated fears among therapists of being replaced by machines will decide on the successful implementation of this most promising field to the benefit of patients. {\textcopyright} 2003 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation after hemiplegic stroke has typically relied on the training of patients in compensatory strategies. The translation of neuroscientific research into care has led to new approaches and renewed promise for better outcomes. Improved motor control can progress with task-specific training incorporating increased use of proximal and distal movements during intensive practice of real-world activities. Functional gains are incorrectly said to plateau by 3-6 months. Many patients retain latent sensorimotor function that can be realised any time after stroke with a pulse of goal-directed therapy. The amount of practice probably best determines gains for a given level of residual movement ability. Clinicians should encourage patients to build greater strength, speed, endurance, and precision of multijoint movements on tasks that increase independence and enrich daily activity. Imaging tools may help clinicians determine the capacity of residual networks to respond to a therapeutic approach and help establish optimal dose-response curves for training. Promising adjunct approaches include practice with robotic devices or in a virtual environment, electrical stimulation to increase cortical excitability during training, and drugs to optimise molecular mechanisms for learning. Biological strategies for neural repair may augment rehabilitation in the next decade.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the therapeutic interventions reported in the research literature and synthesize their effectiveness in improving upper limb (UL) function in the first 4 weeks poststroke. Data Sources: Electronic databases and trial registries were searched from inception until June 2016, in addition to searching systematic reviews by hand. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials, and interventional studies with pre/posttest design were included for adults within 4 weeks of any type of stroke with UL impairment. Participants all received an intervention of any physiotherapeutic or occupational therapeutic technique designed to address impairment or activity of the affected UL, which could be compared with usual care, sham, or another technique. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of full texts, and methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data Synthesis: A total of 104 trials (83 RCTs, 21 nonrandomized studies) were included (N=5225 participants). Meta-analyses of RCTs only (20 comparisons) and narrative syntheses were completed. Key findings included significant positive effects for modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) (standardized mean difference [SMD]=1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI],.21–1.97) and task-specific training (SMD=.37; 95{\%} CI,.05–.68). Evidence was found to support supplementary use of biofeedback and electrical stimulation. Use of Bobath therapy was not supported. Conclusions: Use of mCIMT and task-specific training was supported, as was supplementary use of biofeedback and electrical simulation, within the acute phase poststroke. Further high-quality studies into the initial 4 weeks poststroke are needed to determine therapies for targeted functional UL outcomes.},

The assisted rehabilitation and measurement (ARM) Guide is capable of mechanically guiding reaching and retrieval movements across the workspace and of measuring constraint forces and range of motion during guidance. We tested the device on four hemiplegic brain-injured individuals and four unimpaired control subjects. During guided movement, the brain-injured subjects generated distinct spatial patterns of constraint force with their impaired arms that were consistent with the standard flexion and extension 'synergies' described in the clinical literature. In addition, the impaired arms exhibited well-defined workspace deficits as measured by the ARM Guide. These results suggest that constraint force and range of motion measurements during mechanically guided movement may prove useful for precise monitoring of arm impairment and of the effects of treatment techniques targeted at abnormal synergies and workspace deficits.},

In line with a distal bilateral approach, the equipment comprised 4 workstations, 1 finger trainer, and 3 machines for bilateral training of selected distal and proximal movements. Design: Open study. Subjects: Of 119 treated patients after subacute stroke, 30 completed a questionnaire and 24 were assessed. Methods: All patients completed 15 sessions, each of 30-45 min duration, on each of 2 workstations. Based on the patients' impairment level they were divided into 3 groups, as follows: group A, plegic; group B, proximal and distal movements but hand non-functional; and group C, able to grasp and release an object. Motor functions were assessed with the Fugl-Meyer Score (FM, 0-66) for groups A (n=6) and B (n=6), and the Action Arm Research Test (ARAT, 0-57) for group C (n=12). Results: No side-effects occurred. The patients regarded the training positively. The initial FM was 8.5 (standard deviation (SD) 3.3) and final FM 21.2 (SD 4.4) for group A, initial FM 25.3 (SD 6.9) and final FM 44.3 (SD 9.1) for group B, and initial ARAT 33.3 (SD 11.2) and final ARAT 43.5 (SD 10.7) for group C.

Each force plate is also sensitive to two moments with axis in the same plane as the force plate. If the force plate is to be used as a two component force-moment sensor, we determine which moment axis is best to use. Finally, a novel six-axis load cell is modelled by assembling three force plates together with rotational symmetry. The sensitivity of the six-axis load cell is calculated using FEM. Analysis of the six axis load cell predicts good measurement sensitivity and isotropy while maintaining low interference between measurement axes.

A modified adaptive Kalman filter combined with clipping filtering is proposed for the control system to mitigate the noise and time delay of the collected signal. The clipping filtering method was used to filter the accidental error and avoid the safety problem caused by a mistrigger. A modified adaptive Kalman filter was used to account for the sudden change of the motion state during rehabilitation training. The results show that the intent recognition system designed herein can accurately recognize the human–robot interaction information, and estimate the intent of human motion in time. Therefore, it can be concluded that the designed system effectively follows the predicted motion intent with the proposed method, which is a significant improvement for human–robot interaction control of upper limb extremity rehabilitation robots.},

References listed in relevant publications were also screened. Studies that satisfied the following selection criteria were included: (1) patients were diagnosed with cerebral vascular accident; (2) effects of robot-assisted therapy for the upper limb were investigated; (3) the outcome was measured in terms of motor and/or functional recovery of the upper paretic limb; and (4) the study was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). For each outcome measure, the estimated effect size (ES) and the summary effect size (SES) expressed in standard deviation units (SDU) were calculated for motor recovery and functional ability (activities of daily living [ADLs]) using fixed and random effect models. Ten studies, involving 218 patients, were included in the synthesis. Their methodological quality ranged from 4 to 8 on a (maximum) 10-point scale. Results. Meta-analysis showed a nonsignificant heterogeneous SES in terms of upper limb motor recovery. Sensitivity analysis of studies involving only shoulder-elbow robotics subsequently demonstrated a significant homogeneous SES for motor recovery of the upper paretic limb. No significant SES was observed for functional ability (ADL). Conclusion. As a result of marked heterogeneity in studies between distal and proximal arm robotics, no overall significant effect in favor of robot-assisted therapy was found in the present meta-analysis. However, subsequent sensitivity analysis showed a significant improvement in upper limb motor function after stroke for upper arm robotics. No significant improvement was found in ADL function. However, the administered ADL scales in the reviewed studies fail to adequately reflect recovery of the paretic upper limb, whereas valid instruments that measure outcome of dexterity of the paretic arm and hand are mostly absent in selected studies. Future research into the effects of robot-assisted therapy should therefore distinguish between upper and lower robotics arm training and concentrate on kinematical analysis to differentiate between genuine upper limb motor recovery and functional recovery due to compensation strategies by proximal control of the trunk and upper limb.

abstract = {This paper presents the design and kinematics of a four degree-of-freedom upper extremity rehabilitation robot for stroke therapy, to be used in conjunction with the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) system. The RiceWrist is intended to provide robotic therapy via force-feedback during range-of-motion tasks. The exoskeleton device accommodates forearm supination and pronation, wrist flexion and extension, and radial and ulnar deviation in a compact design with low friction and backlash. Joint range of motion and torque output of the electricmotor driven device is matched to human capabilities. The paper describes the design of the device, along with three control modes that allow for various methods of interaction between the patient and the robotic device. Passive, triggered, and active-constrained modes, such as those developed for MIME, allow for therapist control of therapy protocols based on patient capability and progress. Also presented is the graphical user interface for therapist control of the interactions modes of the RiceWrist, basic experimental protocol, and preliminary experimental results.

abstract = {Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. In this paper, a novel robot-assisted rehabilitation system based on motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) is developed for regular training of neurological rehabilitation for upper limb stroke patients. Firstly, three-dimensional animation was used to guide the patient image the upper limb movement and EEG signals were acquired by EEG amplifier. Secondly, eigenvectors were extracted by harmonic wavelet transform (HWT) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was utilized to classify the pattern of the left and right upper limb motor imagery EEG signals. Finally, PC triggered the upper limb rehabilitation robot to perform motor therapy and gave the virtual feedback. Using this robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation system, the patient's EEG of upper limb movement imagination is translated to control rehabilitation robot directly. Consequently, the proposed rehabilitation system can fully explore the patient's motivation and attention and directly facilitate upper limb post-stroke rehabilitation therapy. Experimental results on unimpaired participants were presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the rehabilitation system. Combining robot-assisted training with motor imagerybased BCI will make future rehabilitation therapy more effective. Clinical testing is still required for further proving this assumption.},

abstract = {Modern technology has been improving, as is medical technology. Over the years, rehabilitation medicine is developing and growing. The use of rehabilitation robots to achieve the upper limb motor function of patients with hemiplegia has also become a popular research in academia. Under this background, this paper proposes an upper limb robot rehabilitation system based on Internet of Things remote control. The upper limb robotic rehabilitation system based on the Internet of Things in this paper is composed of upper computer and lower computer. Information is collected by pressure sensor. The transmission process is realized by STM32 controller, which is first transmitted to the upper computer, and then the information needs to be processed After processing, it sends control commands to the lower computer controller to control the motor drive of the rehabilitation robot, so as to realize the rehabilitation training of the patient. In order to verify the reliability of the system in this paper, this paper conducted a motion test and system dynamic performance test. The research results of this paper show that the passive motion accuracy of the system in this paper has reached more than 97{\%}, and the active motion accuracy has reached more than 98{\%}. In addition, the maximum speed response time of the upper limb rehabilitation robot system based on the remote control of the Internet of Things in this paper is 5.7ms. The amount of adjustment is 5.32{\%}, and the dynamic performance is good. The research results of this paper show that the upper limb rehabilitation robot system based on the Internet of Things remote control in this paper has excellent performance, which can provide a certain reference value for the research of rehabilitation robot.},

abstract = {Background/Aim: Task-specific repetitive training, a usual care in occupational therapy practice, and robotic-aided rehabilitation with bilateral practice are used to improve upper limb motor and task performance. The difference in effects of two strategies requires exploration. This study compared the impact of robotic-assisted therapy with bilateral practice (RTBP) and usual task-specific training facilitated by therapists on task and motor performance for stroke survivors. Methods: Forty-three community-dwelling stroke survivors (20 males; 23 females; 53.3 ± 13.1 years; post-stroke duration 14.2 ± 10.9 months) were randomised into RTBP and usual care. All participants received a 10-minute per-protocol sensorimotor stimulation session prior to interventions as part of usual care. Primary outcome was different in the amount of use (AOU) and quality of movement (QOM) on the Motor Activity Log (MAL) scale at endpoint. Secondary outcomes were AOU and QOM scores at follow-up, and pre-post and follow-up score differences on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and surface electromyography (sEMG). Friedman and Mann–Whitney U tests were used to calculate difference. Results: There were no baseline differences between groups. Both conditions demonstrated significant within-group improvements in AOU-MAL and FMA scores following treatment (P {\textless} 0.05) and improvements in FMA scores at follow-up (P {\textless} 0.05). The training-induced improvement in AOU (30.0{\%}) following treatment was greater than the minimal detectable change (16.8{\%}) in the RTBP group. RTBP demonstrated better outcomes in FMA wrist score (P = 0.003) and sEMG of wrist extensor (P = 0.043) following treatment and in AOU (P {\textless} 0.001), FMA total score (P = 0.006), FMA wrist score (P {\textless} 0.001) and sEMG of wrist extensor (P = 0.017) at follow-up compared to the control group. Control group boost more beneficial effects on FMA hand score (P = 0.049) following treatment. Conclusions: RTBP demonstrated superior upper limb motor and task performance outcomes compared to therapists-facilitated task training when both were preceded by a 10-minute sensorimotor stimulation session.

In the current study, we attempted to investigate differences in cortical activation according to the speed of passive hand movements performed by a rehabilitation robotic hand. Nine normal subjects were recruited for this study. Passive movements of the right hand were performed by the rehabilitation robotic hand using three different speeds: 1 Hz (fast), 0.5 Hz (moderate) and 0.25 Hz (slow). We measured values of oxy-haemoglobin (HbO) in four regions of interest: the primary sensory-motor cortex (SM1), supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The HbO value in the left SM1 was significantly higher during movements performed at 0.5 Hz than during movements performed at 1 Hz and 0.25 Hz (p {\textless} 0.05); in contrast, no significant differences were observed in the left SMA, PMC and PFC (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The results of a group analysis of HbO showed a significant activation in the left SM1, SMA and PFC during movements performed at 0.5 Hz. By contrast, significantly less activation was observed in the left SM1 during movements performed at 1 Hz and 0.25 Hz. This study showed that movements performed at 0.5 Hz by a rehabilitation robotic hand induced the greatest cortical activation in the contralateral SM1. As a result, it appears that hand movements performed at a moderate speed by the rehabilitation robotic hand could induce the greatest cortical activation in the contralateral SM1.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) on gait function in burn patients. Briefly, 40 burn patients were randomly divided into an RAGT group or a conventional training (CON) group. SUBAR{\textregistered} (Cretem, Korea) is a wearable robot with a footplate that simulates normal gait cycles. The RAGT group underwent 30 min of robot-assisted training using SUBAR{\textregistered} with 30 min of conventional physiotherapy once a day, 5 days a week for 12 weeks. Patients in the CON group received 30 min of overground gait training and range-of-motion (ROM) exercises twice a day for 5 days a week for 12 weeks. The RAGT group and the CON group underwent 60 min of training per day. The intervention frequency and duration did not differ between the RAGT group and the CON group. The main outcomes were functional ambulatory category (FAC); 6-min walking test (6MWT); visual analogue scale (VAS) during gait movement; ROM; and isometric forces of bilateral hip, knee, and ankle muscles before and after 12 weeks of training. The results of the VAS, FAC, and 6MWT (8.06 ± 0.66, 1.76 ± 0.56, and 204.41 ± 85.60) before training in the RAGT group improved significantly (4.41 ± 1.18, 4.18 ± 0.39, and 298.53 ± 47.75) after training (p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001, and p {\textless} 0.001). The results of the VAS, FAC, and 6MWT (8.00 ± 1.21, 1.75 ± 0.58, and 220.94 ± 116.88) before training in the CON group improved significantly (5.00 ± 1.03, 3.81 ± 1.05, and 272.19 ± 110.14) after training (p {\textless} 0.001, p {\textless} 0.001, and p = 0.05). There were differences in the improvement of results of the VAS, FAC, and 6MWT between groups after training, but they were not statistically significant (p = 0.23, p = 0.14, and p = 0.05). The isometric strengths of the right hip extensor (p = 0.02), bilateral knee flexor (p = 0.04 in the right, and p = 0.001 in the left), bilateral knee extensor (p = 0.003 in the right, and p = 0.002 in the left), bilateral ankle dorsiflexor (p = 0.04 in the right, and p = 0.02 in the left), and bilateral ankle plantarflexor (p = 0.001 in the right, and p = 0.008 in the left) after training were significantly improved compared with those before training in the RAGT group. The ROMs of the right knee extension (p = 0.03) and bilateral ankle plantarflexion (p = 0.008 in the right, and p = 0.03 in the left) were significantly improved compared with measurements before training in the RAGT. There were no significant differences of the isometric strengths and ROMs of the bilateral hip, knee, and ankle muscles after training in the CON group. There were significant improvements in the isometric strengths of the left knee flexor (p = 0.01), left ankle dorsiflexor (p = 0.01), and left ankle plantarflexor (p = 0.003) between the two groups. The results suggested that RAGT is effective to facilitate early recovery of muscles strength after a burn injury. This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of RAGT in patients with burns compared with those receiving conventional training. The absence of complications in burn patients provides an opportunity to enlarge the application area of RAGT.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - Overcoming chronic hemiparesis from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) can be challenging for many patients, especially after the first 12 months after the CVA. With the use of established motor control theories, the present study investigated electromyogram (EMG)-triggered neuromuscular stimulation and bilateral coordination training. Methods - Twenty-five CVA subjects volunteered to participate in this motor recovery protocol study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) coupled protocol of EMG-triggered stimulation and bilateral movement (n=10); (2) EMG-triggered stimulation and unilateral movement (n=10); or (3) control (n=5). All participants completed 6 hours of rehabilitation during a 2-week period according to group assignments. Motor capabilities of the wrist and fingers were evaluated on the basis of 3 categories of motor tasks in a pretest-posttest control group design. Results - Significant findings for the (1) number of blocks moved in a functional task, (2) chronometric reaction times to initiate movements, and (3) sustained muscle contraction capability all favored the coupled bilateral movement training and EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation protocol group. In addition, the unilateral movement/stimulation group exceeded the control group in the number of blocks moved and rapid onset of muscle contractions. Conclusions - This new evidence is convincing in that subjects in the coupled protocol group were able to demonstrate enhanced voluntary motor control across 3 categories of tasks. Chronic hemiparesis decreased considerably in the wrist and fingers as CVA patients expanded their motor repertoire.},

abstract = {Based on the suboptimal research pathways that finally led to multicenter randomized clinical trials (MRCTs) of treadmill training with partial body weight support and of robotic assistive devices, strategically planned successive stages are proposed for pilot studies of novel rehabilitation interventions. Stage 1, consideration-of-concept studies, drawn from animal experiments, theories, and observations, delineate the experimental intervention in a small convenience sample of participants, so the results must be interpreted with caution. Stage 2, development-of-concept pilots, should optimize the components of the intervention, settle on most appropriate outcome measures, and examine dose-response effects. A well-designed study that reveals no efficacy should be published to counterweight the confirmation bias of positive trials. Stage 3, demonstration-of-concept pilots, can build out from what has been learned to test at least 15 participants in each arm, using random assignment and blinded outcome measures. A control group should receive an active practice intervention aimed at the same primary outcome. A third arm could receive a substantially larger dose of the experimental therapy or a combinational intervention. If only 1 site performed this trial, a different investigative group should aim to reproduce positive outcomes based on the optimal dose of motor training. Stage 3 studies ought to suggest an effect size of 0.4 or higher, so that approximately 50 participants in each arm will be the number required to test for efficacy in a stage 4, proof-of-concept MRCT. By developing a consensus around acceptable and necessary practices for each stage, similar to CONSORT recommendations for the publication of phase III clinical trials, better quality pilot studies may move quickly into better designed and more successful MRCTs of experimental interventions. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

Objective To investigate interlimb coupling in an adult population with left hemiplegia and an age-matched control group to better understand the unique motor control issues in stroke rehabilitation. Design A chi-square analysis was performed to compare the distribution of participants adopting a given movement pattern ratio during 2 different bimanual movement tasks for both groups. The task involved oscillating the upper limbs at the elbow in asymmetric patterns, with 1 limb oscillating at twice the frequency of the other. Setting Testing was done in the subjects' residences or in an outpatient clinic. Participants Participants were between the ages of 45 and 75 years (mean ± standard deviation, 63±9.4y), right handed, and included 18 left hemiparetic and 18 control subjects. Selection criteria for the hemiparetic group included status after nonhemorrhagic stroke within the distribution area of the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA). Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measure Relative phase of the upper extremities. Results The hemiplegic group produced predominantly an in-phase 1-to-1 movement pattern, whereas the control group exhibited antiphase, 2-to-1 movement harmonics and, to a lesser extent, in-phase movement patterns. Conclusions This study suggests that brain damage caused by stroke in the RMCA distribution area results in the reduction of selectable interlimb movement patterns. Specifically, bimanual upper extremity movement tended to be highly coupled in an in-phase movement pattern. Research is needed to examine the ability of stroke survivors to learn bilateral upper-extremity tasks at less stable levels of interlimb coupling. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

The outcome used was the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys severity scale for disability. Odds ratios and population-attributable fractions were calculated to examine the associations between diagnoses and disability. Results: Logistic regression modelling suggests that, after adjustment for comorbidity and age, those with stroke had the highest odds of reporting severe overall disability (odds ratio 4.88, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 3.37-6.10). Stroke was also associated with more individual domains of disability than any of the other conditions considered. Adjusted population-attributable fractions were also calculated and indicated that musculoskeletal disorders had the highest population-attributable fraction (30.3{\%}, 95{\%} CI 26.2-34.1) followed by mental disorders (8.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI 6.9-9.5) and stroke (4.5{\%}, 95{\%} CI 3.6-5.3). Conclusion: Stroke is not the most common cause of disability among the noninstitutionalized United Kingdom population. However, stroke is associated with the highest odds of reporting severe disability. Importantly, stroke is associated with more individual domains of disability compared with other conditions and might be considered to be the most common cause of complex disability. {\textcopyright} 2004 by National Stroke Association.},

abstract = {Hemiparesis is the most common motor deficit following stroke. Bimanual training and robot-assisted therapy are often used to regain motor functionality of the paretic limb. The goal of this study is the development and validation of a bimanual training system that stimulates the use of both arms of hemiparetic subjects. The adaptive assistance control adjusts the contribution of the unaffected arm, thus reducing the load on the paretic arm. Hemiparetic subjects performed three different tracking exercises in bimanual mode and in two unimanual modes to validate the applicability of the system. In bimanual mode, the patient uses the unaffected limb to initiate and guide the movement. The movement of the paretic limb must be coordinated with the unaffected limb to complete the exercise. The training resulted in improvements of motor performance. High and significant correlation between bimanual training and unimanual performance was observed. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2011.},

abstract = {An exoskeleton is a wearable robot with joints and links corresponding to those of the human body. With applications in rehabilitation medicine, virtual reality simulation, and teleoperation, exoskeletons offer benefits for both disabled and healthy populations. Analytical and experimental approaches were used to develop, integrate, and study a powered exoskeleton for the upper limb and its application as an assistive device. The kinematic and dynamic dataset of the upper limb during daily living activities was one among several factors guiding the development of an anthropomorphic, seven degree-of-freedom, powered arm exoskeleton. Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of cable-pulley reductions were incorporated into the design, leading to low inertia, high-stiffness links, and back-drivable transmissions with zero backlash. The design enables full glenohumeral, elbow, and wrist joint functionality. Establishing the human-machine interface at the neural level was facilitated by the development of a Hill-based muscle model (myoprocessor) that enables intuitive interaction between the operator and the wearable robot. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include (i) an assistive (orthotic) device for human power amplifications, (ii) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, (iii) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and (iv) a master device for teleoperation. {\textcopyright} 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {With the growing adoption of virtualized datacenters and cloud hosting services, the allocation and sizing of resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth for virtual machines (VMs) is becoming increasingly important. Accurate performance modeling of an application would help users in better VM sizing, thus reducing costs. It can also benefit cloud service providers who can offer a new charging model based on the VMs' performance instead of their configured sizes. In this paper, we present techniques to model the performance of a VM-hosted application as a function of the resources allocated to the VM and the resource contention it experiences. To address this multi-dimensional modeling problem, we propose and refine the use of two machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). We evaluate these modeling techniques using five virtualized applications from the RUBiS and Filebench suite of benchmarks and demonstrate that their median and 90th percentile prediction errors are within 4.36{\%} and 29.17{\%} respectively. These results are substantially better than regression based approaches as well as direct applications of machine learning techniques without our refinements. We also present a simple and effective approach to VM sizing and empirically demonstrate that it can deliver optimal results for 65{\%} of the sizing problems that we studied and produces close-to-optimal sizes for the remaining 35{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {This article presents the design of a hand exoskeleton that features its modularity and the possibility of integrating a force sensor in its frame. The modularity is achieved by dividing the exoskeleton in separate units, each one driving a finger or pair of them. These units or “finger modules” have a single degree of freedom and may be easily attached or removed from the robot frame and human fingers by snap-in fixations. As for the force sensing capability, the device relies on a novel force sensor that uses optical elements to amplify and measure small elastic deformations in the robot structure. This sensor can be fully integrated as a structural element of the finger module. The proposed technology has been validated in two experimental sessions. A first study was performed in a clinical environment in order to check whether the hand exoskeleton (without the integrated force sensor) can successfully move an impaired hand in a “Mirror Therapy” environment. A second study was carried with healthy subjects to check the technical feasibility of using the integrated force sensor as a human–machine interface.},

Design: Subjects performed daily practice sessions of three specific upper limb tasks over a four-week period. Performance of the tasks was recorded on video for later analysis over the duration of the study. For the first week of the training period the tasks were practised with the impaired upper limb. Only then, with a random start day between 8 and 13, the tasks were practised using a bilateral training protocol. Functional assessments of the affected upper limb and neurophysiological investigations of contra- and ipsilateral pathways from the affected and nonaffected cortical hemispheres were completed prior to the start of the intervention, at the end of the unimanual practice period, and at the conclusion of the bimanual practice period. Subjects: Six individuals between one month and four years post stroke. Interventions: Unimanual and bimanual training protocols. Main measures: Task performance with the affected limb only; motor impairment of the affected upper limb; ipsi- and contralateral corticospinal pathway excitability. Results: Baseline task performance varied markedly between subjects. Most individuals demonstrated little, if any, additional beneficial effect of bimanual practice on task performance. Results of neurophysiological investigations were inconsistent between subjects. Conclusions: Short-term bilateral training following unilateral training may have limited effectiveness in enhancing upper limb motor performance in acute and chronic individuals poststroke. The neural mechanisms associated with bilateral activation therapies remain uncertain.},

Robotic devices have been used in recent years to enhance sensori-motor recovery of the impaired arm in persons with stroke. Despite recent recommendations for bimanual practice, robot-assisted bimanual activities are rarely explored and are limited to mirror image movements. We developed a novel parallel movement mode for the Mirror Image Movement Enabler robotic system and investigated trajectory error (TE) exhibited by healthy adults during parallel and mirror image motions to various target locations. TE values differed for parallel and mirror image motions and for certain target locations, suggesting the importance of considering these factors when developing robot-assisted bimanual activities. {\textcopyright} 2011 The authors.},

abstract = {The corticospinal projection is considered to influence fine motor function through nearly exclusively contralateral projections from the cortex in primates. However, unilateral lesions to this system in various species are frequently followed by significant functional improvement, raising the possibility that bilateral projections of this pathway may exist or emerge after injury. To examine the detailed anatomy and projections of the corticospinal motor neurons in rhesus monkeys (n = 4), we injected the high-resolution anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into 126 sites centered about the right lower extremity (LE) primary motor cortex. Projection and termination patterns were quantified at lumbar levels L1, L4, and L7 and mapped by using serial-section reconstructions. Notably, a mean of 10.1 ± 0.6{\%} (± SEM) of corticospinal tract (CST) axons descended in the lateral CST ipsilateral to the cortical BDA injection, and 87.9 ± 1.0{\%} of total CST axons projected in the contralateral lateral CST. The ipsilateral ventral CST contained only 1.0 ± 0{\%} of all projecting CST axons, whereas the contralateral ventral CST contained 0.3 ± 0.2{\%} of all axons. In addition, a minor dorsal column CST projection was identified. Measurement of BDA-labeled terminals in the spinal cord gray matter revealed that 11.2 ± 2.2{\%} of CST axons terminated ipsilateral to the side of cortical injection, and the remainder terminated contralaterary. As previously reported, most CST axons terminated in spinal cord laminae V-VIII, as well as the laterodorsal motoneuronal group of lamina IX (which innervates distal extremity muscles). Notably, many CST axons crossed the spinal cord midline (mean 19.9 ± 4.9 axons per 40-$\mu$m-thick section). Detailed single-axon reconstructions revealed that most ipsilaterally projecting lateral CST axons terminated in ipsilateral gray matter. Notably, we found that the bouton-like swellings of many ipsilateral CST axons descending in the dorsolateral tract were located within Rexed's lamina IX, in close proximity to motoneuronal somata. Thus, bilateral projections of corticospinal axons originating from a single motor cortex could contribute to bilateral control of spinal motor neurons and to the highly evolved degree of fine motor control in primates. Furthermore, bilateral CST projections from a single motor cortex could represent a potential source of plasticity after injury, as well as a target of therapeutic effort in neural regeneration strategies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - To compare a computerized arm trainer (AT), allowing repetitive practice of passive and active bilateral forearm and wrist movement cycle, and electromyography-initiated electrical stimulation (ES) of the paretic wrist extensor in severely affected subacute stroke patients. Method - A total of 44 patients, 4 to 8 weeks after stroke causing severe arm paresis (Fugl-Meyer Motor Score [FM, O to 66] {\textless}18), were randomly assigned to either AT or ES. All patients practiced 20 minutes every workday for 6 weeks. AT patients performed 800 repetitions per session with the robot and ES patients performed 60 to 80 wrist extensions per session. The primary outcome measure was the blindly assessed FM (0 to 66), and the secondary measures were the upper limb muscle power (Medical Research Council [MRC] sum, 0 to 45) and muscle tone (Ashworth score sum, 0 to 25), assessed at the beginning and end of treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Results - The AT group had a higher Barthel Index score at baseline, but the groups were otherwise homogenous. As expected, FM and MRC sum scores improved overtime in both groups but significantly more in the robot AT group. The initial Barthel Index score had no influence. In the robot AT group, FM score was 15 points higher at study end and 13 points higher at 3-month follow-up than the control ES group. MRC sum score was 15 points higher at study end and at 3-month follow-up compared with the control ES group. Muscle tone remained unchanged, and no side effects occurred. Conclusion - The computerized active arm training produced a superior improvement in upper limb motor control and power compared with ES in severely affected stroke patients. This is probably attributable to the greater number of repetitions and the bilateral approach. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted bilateral training is being developed as a new rehabilitation approach for stroke patients. However, there is still a lack of understanding of muscle functions when performing robot-assisted synchronous movements. The aim of this work is to explore the muscle activation patterns and the voluntary effort of participants during different robot-assisted bilateral training protocols. To this end, 10 healthy participants were recruited to take part in a 60-minute experiment. The experiment included two different bilateral exercises, and each exercise contained four different training protocols. Trajectories of the robots, interaction force and surface electromyogram signals were recorded during training. The results show that the robots do affect the muscle activation patterns during different training protocols and exercises rather than the controller. Specifically, the activity of muscles is reduced in robot-assisted training but is increased in active force involved robot-assisted training when compared to robot-unassisted training. Meanwhile, the voluntary effort of participants can be presented by the adjusted trajectories via the controller. In addition, the results also suggest that the activations for the same muscle groups in the left and right arms are highly correlated with each other in both exercises. Furthermore, the training protocols and methods developed in this work could be further extended in future clinical trials to investigate therapeutic outcomes for patients as well as to better understand bilateral recovery processes.},

abstract = {Objective. Previous studies in rehabilitation in poststroke hemiplegia have suggested that brief periods of bilateral training improve subsequent unilateral performance of the paretic upper limb. The bilateral training protocol involved task-specific practice using both upper limbs simultaneously and homologously (such that they mirrored each other). This study aimed to determine the generalizability of the bilateral training phenomenon by replicating the work with different tasks, measures, and a different experimenter. Methods. Five single-case experiments were performed using a within-participant multiple-baseline design. Participants with poststroke hemiplegia underwent 25 to 40 daily training sessions involving repetitive practice of 3 copying tasks. Pen movements were recorded on a digitizing pad. During the baseline phase, participants performed tasks unilaterally with their hemiplegic limb. Bilateral therapy was then applied in a staggered fashion to each task in turn. Quality of movement was measured in terms of temporal performance (jerkiness, speed, task duration), spatial performance (accuracy of copy), and arm posture (pen tilt). Results. Movement quality of the hemiplegic limb was not improved during or subsequent to regular bilateral training. Conclusions. The training phenomenon observed in previous work was not replicated when participants with hemiplegia practiced copying tasks bilaterally.

In addition, they do not provide a mapping between the structural bases of various pathologies and the associated disorders of movement.

A way of increasing treatment access could be through robots, which would aid therapists in providing post-stroke rehabilitation. This research sought to discover the needs and preferences of therapists with respect to a robot that focuses on upper limb rehabilitation. Understanding requirements for devices could help to increase integration into clinical practice. Methods. An international online survey was distributed through professional organisations and e-mail list services to therapists. The survey contained 85 items covering topics such as therapist background and treatment approach, rehabilitation aims and robotic rehabilitation device attributes. Results. Data were analysed for 233 respondents, most of whom were physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Australia, Canada and USA. Top attributes included: facilitating a variety of arm movements, being usable while seated, giving biofeedback to clients, having virtual activities specific to daily living, being useful in-home and having resistance adjustable to client needs. In addition, the device should cost under 6000 USD. Conclusions. Findings from this survey provide guidance for technology developers regarding therapists' specifications for a robotic device for upper limb rehabilitation. In addition, findings offer a better understanding of how acceptance of such devices may be facilitated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

Infarcts caused a marked but transient deficit in use of the contralateral hand, as evidenced by increased use of the ipsilateral hand, and reduced performance on a task requiring skilled digit use. 3. Infarcts resulted in a widespread reduction in the areal extent of digit representations adjacent to the lesion, and apparent increases in adjacent proximal representations. 4. We conclude that substantial functional reorganization occurs in primary motor cortex of adult primates following a focal ischemic infarct, but at least in the absence of postinfarct training, the movements formerly represented in the infarcted zone do not reappear in adjacent cortical regions.},

abstract = {The existing shortage of therapists and caregivers assisting physically disabled individuals at home is expected to increase and become serious problem in the near future. The patient population needing physical rehabilitation of the upper extremity is also constantly increasing. Robotic devices have the potential to address this problem as noted by the results of recent research studies. However, the availability of these devices in clinical settings is limited, leaving plenty of room for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to document a review of robotic devices for upper limb rehabilitation including those in developing phase in order to provide a comprehensive reference about existing solutions and facilitate the development of new and improved devices. In particular the following issues are discussed: application field, target group, type of assistance, mechanical design, control strategy and clinical evaluation. This paper also includes a comprehensive, tabulated comparison of technical solutions implemented in various systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Maciejasz et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {There are a certain number of arm dysfunction patients whose legs could move. Considering the neuronal coupling between arms and legs during locomotion, this paper proposes a novel human-robot cooperative method for upper extremity rehabilitation. Legs motion is considered at the passive rehabilitation training of disabled arm, and its traversed trajectory is represented by the patient trunk motion. A Kinect based vision module, two computers and a WAM robot construct the human-robot cooperative upper extremity rehabilitation system. The vision module is employed to track the position of the subject trunk in horizontal; the WAM robot is used to guide the arm of post-stroke patient to do passive training with the predefined trajectory, and meanwhile the robot follows the patient trunk movement which is tracked by Kinect in real-time. A hierarchical fuzzy control strategy is proposed to improve the position tracking performance and stability of the system, which consists of an external fuzzy dynamic interpolation strategy and an internal fuzzy PD position controller. Four experiments were conducted to test the proposed method and strategy. The experimental results show that the patient felt more natural and comfortable when the human-robot cooperative method was applied; the subject could walk as he/she wished in the visual range of Kinect. The hierarchical fuzzy control strategy performed well in the experiments. This indicates the high potential of the proposed human-robot cooperative method for upper extremity rehabilitation.},

Methods: Sixteen chronic stroke subjects were randomly selected to complete 5 effective upper extremity treatment protocols over 12 months. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment orders. Consistent across the orders and protocols, the participants completed 90 min of training per day for 4 days during separate 2-week rehabilitation periods. Results: Data for the 5 primary outcome measures were analyzed in separate mixed design ANOVAs (treatment order × test session: 2 × 6). The analyses revealed distinct cumulative treatment evidence later in training in comparison to the baseline motor capabilities: (1) higher number of blocks moved; (2) higher percentage of blocks moved by the impaired hand; (3) faster motor reaction time (peripheral component), and (4) faster total reaction time. Conclusions: These chronic stroke patients displayed robust cumulative motor improvement effects from the longitudinally distributed practice of active neuromuscular stimulation and coupled bilateral movements.

abstract = {Objective: To determine how stroke lesion side and ipsilateral motor pathways influence motor performance in bimanual tasks. Methods: Stroke subjects and age-matched controls participated in two data collection sessions: (1) motor behavior was examined during a movement task performed in unimanual, bimanual symmetric, and bimanual asymmetric conditions and (2) transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to examine the excitability of ipsilateral and contralateral motor pathways during isometric unilateral and bilateral muscle activation. Results: Subjects with left hemiparesis and controls demonstrated a performance differential between symmetric and asymmetric motor tasks compared to subjects with right hemiparesis. Contralateral motor pathway excitability decreased and ipsilateral pathway excitability increased during bilateral compared to unilateral activation in control subjects and in the non-affected arm of stroke subjects. Responses in the affected arm were similar to controls in subjects with left hemiparesis but not right. Conclusions: Changes in motor pathway excitability during bilateral activation may promote more stable performance of symmetric movements. In individuals with hemiparesis, the side of lesion influences neural and behavioral aspects of bimanual tasks. Those with injuries to the right hemisphere exhibit coupling that is more similar to age-matched controls. Significance: The efficacy of bilateral training interventions may be different between people with lesions in the left and right hemispheres. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effects of unilateral hybrid therapy (UHT) and bilateral hybrid therapy (BHT) compared with robot-assisted therapy (RT) alone in patients with chronic stroke. Design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Four hospitals. Participants: Outpatients with chronic stroke and mild to moderate motor impairment (N=44). Intervention: UHT combined unilateral RT (URT) and modified constraint-induced therapy. BHT combined bilateral RT (BRT) and bilateral arm training. The RT group received URT and BRT. The intervention frequency for the 3 groups was 90 min/d 3 d/wk for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA, divided into the proximal and distal subscale) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores before, immediately after, and 3 months after treatment and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale scores before and immediately after treatment. Results: The results favored BHT over UHT on the FMA total score and distal score at the posttest (P=.03 and .04) and follow-up (P=.01 and .047) assessment and BHT over RT on the follow-up FMA distal scores (P=.03). At the posttest assessment, the WMFT and SIS scores of the 3 groups improved significantly without between-group differences, and the RT group showed significantly greater improvement in the mobility domain of NEADL compared with the BHT group (P{\textless}.01). Conclusions: BHT was more effective for improving upper extremity motor function, particularly distal motor function at follow-up, and individuals in the RT group demonstrated improved functional ambulation post intervention.},

abstract = {Objective and design: Bilateral movement training is being increasingly used as a post-stroke motor rehabilitation protocol. The contemporary emphasis on evidence-based medicine warrants a prospective meta-analysis to determine the overall effectiveness of rehabilitating with bilateral movements. Methods: After searching reference lists of bilateral motor recovery articles as well as PubMed and Cochrane databases, 11 stroke rehabilitation studies qualified for this systematic review. An essential requirement for inclusion was that the bilateral training protocols involved either functional tasks or repetitive arm movements. Each study had one of three common arm and hand functional outcome measures: Fugl-Meyer, Box and Block, and kinematic performance. Results: The fixed effects model primary meta-analysis revealed an overall effect size (ES = 0.732, S.D. = 0.13). These findings indicate that bilateral movement training was beneficial for improving motor recovery post-stroke. Moreover, a fail-safe analysis indicated that 48 null effects would be necessary to lower the mean effect size to an insignificant level. Conclusion: These meta-analysis findings indicate that bilateral movements alone or in combination with auxiliary sensory feedback are effective stroke rehabilitation protocols during the sub-acute and chronic phases of recovery. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This randomized, controlled, multisite Department of Veterans Affairs clinical trial assessed robot-assisted (RA) upper-limb therapy with the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) in the acute stroke rehabilitation setting. Hemiparetic subjects (n = 54) received RA therapy using MIME for either up to 15 hours (low-dose) or 30 hours (high-dose) or received up to 15 hours of additional conventional therapy in addition to usual care (control). The primary outcome measure was the Fugl- Meyer Assessment (FMA). The secondary outcome measures were the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Wolf Motor Function Test, Motor Power, and Ashworth scores at intake, discharge, and 6-month follow-up. Mean duration of study treatment was 8.6, 15.8, and 9.4 hours for the low-dose, high-dose, and control groups, respectively. Gains in the primary outcome measure were not significantly different between groups at follow- up. Significant correlations were found at discharge between FMA gains and the dose and intensity of RA. Intensity also correlated with FMA gain at 6 months. The high-dose group had greater FIM gains than controls at discharge and greater tone but no difference in FIM changes compared with low-dose subjects at 6 months. As used during acute rehabilitation, motor-control changes at follow-up were no less with MIME than with additional conventional therapy. Intensity of training with MIME was positively correlated with motor-control gains.},

abstract = {Robot-Assisted arm therapy is increasingly applied in neurorehabilitation. The reason for this development over the last decades was that robots relieve the therapist from hard physical work while the training intensity can be increased. Importantly, an increase in training intensity is closely linked to functional improvements of the patient. However, usability of the robot for therapists was hardly considered an important factor in rehabilitation robot development so far. We believe that usability of the robot is a key factor for acceptance of the device by therapists. In this paper, an online adaptive compensation for the ARMin rehabilitation robot is presented, which aims at improving usability of the robot. Therefore, we expect ARMin therapy to become even more effective than conventional therapy at a level that is also relevant for the patient. Additionally, improved usability relieves the therapist from unnecessary/time-consuming tasks linked to robot handling. For the ARMin, the new online adaptive compensation takes over automatic updates of changed upper and lower arm lengths as well as adaptation of shoulder angle settings to fit the patient's anthropometry. Simultaneously, the model-based compensation in ARMin is directly updated to account for hardware changes. Importantly, the online adaptive compensation provides improved performance of ARMin even at the borders of the workspace. In experiments, we could show that the adaptive online compensation relieves the force and position controller from additional burdens and increases the robot performance drastically especially at the workspace border.},

Enhanced activation changes were observed in bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) and bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) after RBAT. Dynamic causal model analysis revealed that interhemispheric connections were enhanced in RBAT patients.

The classic definition is mainly clinical and does not account for advances in science and technology. The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened a writing group to develop an expert consensus document for an updated definition of stroke for the 21st century. Central nervous system infarction is defined as brain, spinal cord, or retinal cell death attributable to ischemia, based on neuropathological, neuroimaging, and/or clinical evidence of permanent injury. Central nervous system infarction occurs over a clinical spectrum: Ischemic stroke specifically refers to central nervous system infarction accompanied by overt symptoms, while silent infarction by definition causes no known symptoms. Stroke also broadly includes intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The updated definition of stroke incorporates clinical and tissue criteria and can be incorporated into practice, research, and assessments of the public health. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms are typically run on large scale, distributed compute infrastructure that routinely face a number of unavailabilities such as failures and temporary slowdowns. Adding redundant computations using coding-theoretic tools called "codes" is an emerging technique to alleviate the adverse effects of such unavailabilities. A code consists of an encoding function that proactively introduces redundant computation and a decoding function that reconstructs unavailable outputs using the available ones. Past work focuses on using codes to provide resilience for linear computations and specific iterative optimization algorithms. However, computations performed for a variety of applications including inference on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, typically fall outside this realm. In this paper, we propose taking a learning-based approach to designing codes that can handle non-linear computations. We present carefully designed neural network architectures and a training methodology for learning encoding and decoding functions that produce approximate reconstructions of unavailable computation results. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach: we show that the our learned codes can accurately reconstruct {\$}64 - 98\backslash{\%}{\$} of the unavailable predictions from neural-network based image classifiers on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work proposes the first learning-based approach for designing codes, and also presents the first coding-theoretic solution that can provide resilience for any non-linear (differentiable) computation. Our results show that learning can be an effective technique for designing codes, and that learned codes are a highly promising approach for bringing the benefits of coding to non-linear computations.},

abstract = {Motor improvements in chronic stroke recovery accrue from coupled protocols of bilateral movements and active neuromuscular stimulation. This experiment investigated coupled protocols and within-limb transfer between distal and proximal joint combinations. The leading question focused on within-limb transfer of coupled protocols on distal joints to a bimanual aiming task that involved proximal joints. Twenty-six volunteers completed one of three motor recovery protocols according to group assignments: (1) coupled bilateral involved concurrent wrist/finger movements on the unimpaired limb coupled with active stimulation on the impaired limb; (2) unilateral/active stimulation involved neuromuscular electromyogram-triggered stimulation on the impaired wrist/fingers; and (3) no protocol (control group). During the pretest and posttest, subjects performed transverse plane target aiming movements (29 cm) with vision available. The coupled bilateral group showed positive intralimb transfer post-treatment when both arms moved simultaneously. During the posttest, the coupled bilateral group displayed improved movement time, higher peak limb velocity, less variability in peak velocity, and less percentage of total movement time in the deceleration phase than during the pretest. The evidence confirms that within-limb transfer from distal joint training to proximal joint combinations is viable and generalizable in chronic stroke rehabilitation. Moreover, these intralimb transfer findings extend the evidence favoring motor improvements for coupled bilateral protocols during chronic stroke. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

UL rehabilitation using bilateral exercise enhances outcomes and the Bilateral Upper Limb Trainer (BUiLT) was developed to provide symmetrical, bilateral arm exercise in a 'forced' and self-assistive manner, incorporating virtual reality (VR) to provide direction and task specificity to users as well as action observationexecution and greater motivation to exercise. Methods. The BUiLT + VR system was trialled on five post-stroke participants with UL hemiparesis: one sub-acute and four chronic. The intervention was supplied for 45min, 4 days/week for 6 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity score (FMA-UE) was used as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures used were UL isometric strength and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire. Results. The BUiLT + VR therapy increased FMA-UE scores from 1 to 5 and overall strength in the shoulder and elbow. Motivation at the end of intervention was positive. Conclusions.Therapy using the BUiLT + VR system is reliable, can be administered safely and has a positive trend of benefit as measured by the FMA-UE, isometric strength testing and IMI questionnaire. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities, in Georgetown County, South Carolina, were randomly selected for sample collection. The analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic. Low, but acceptable concentrations of chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found. A few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead. Although only 2{\%} of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05 ppm for arsenic, 72{\%} exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm. The mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37{\%} of the waters while 88{\%} exceeded the limit for iron. The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45{\%} of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality. Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phsophate, iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies. Lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters. {\textcopyright} 1975 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the use of a new test apparatus and new testing methods for calibrating multi-axis load cells and minimizing off-axis crosstalk. The test apparatus was developed at the Crew Systems Directorate of the Armstrong Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio where multi-axis load cells are used in manikin testing to predict potential air crew member injury. The Denton Inc. six channel head/neck load cell was chosen for the tests because of its unique loading through the occipital condyle pin and nodding block surfaces and its importance in impact testing for providing essential neck loading data. Two load cells were used in the comparison study between the new test apparatus, the previous calibrating device - a prototype to the new fixture, and the load cell manufacturer to validate the current system and demonstrate its improved capabilities. The two load cells were calibrated on the previous fixture using the currently accepted method for that device. The same two load cells were then tested on the new fixture using four new calibration methods. The load cells were then calibrated by the manufacturer. The load cells were calibrated in all six axes for each test and data were collected on all channels during each axis calibration. These data were then reduced to 6 × 6 sensitivity matrices. The results from the different methods were compared and evaluated with particular assessment of off-axis crosstalk. The criteria for the best method was based upon the minimization of off-axis crosstalk and accuracy to full scale loading when the sensitivities and load sensitivity matrix are multiplied. The new test apparatus demonstrated improved capabilities.},

@article{Hijmans2011a,
abstract = {This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a bilateral, self-supported, upper-limb rehabilitation intervention using a movement-based game controller for people with chronic stroke. Fourteen participants received a control treatment, followed by a washout period, and then the intervention. The intervention comprised playing computer games with the CyWee Z (CyWee Group Ltd; Taipei, Taiwan), a movement-based game controller similar to the Nintendo Wii remote. The CyWee Z was incorporated into a handlebar, making bilateral exercises possible by allowing the unaffected side to support and assist the affected side. The intervention lasted for 8 to 10 sessions of 45 to 60 minutes over a period of 2.5 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper-limb section (FMA-UL) was used as the primary outcome. The Wolf Motor Function Test and the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcome measure were used as secondary outcomes. Postintervention, motor performance as measured by the FMA-UL was significantly improved compared with all preintervention assessments (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas no changes were found on both secondary outcomes. It can be concluded from this pilot study that upper-limb motor performance of adults with chronic stroke improves with repetitive, game-assisted, self-supported bilateral exercises.},

Firstly, a method to distinguish the impaired side from the healthy side using sEMG signals are proposed, and its accuracy is verified by simulation experiments. Through this experiment, some better feature are chosen to evaluate the muscle strength. sEMG signals of the upper-limb muscles of the patients are denoised and analyzed in time domain and frequency domain. sEMG signals are then obtained into the training set and the test set, using the training set to make the weighed evaluation for the unknown rehabilitation stage and calculate the final classification results.

abstract = {In recent years, the treatment process of patients and disabled people who need rehabilitation and physical medicine has become more effective with the use of new devices and developing technology. The rehabilitation robot is one of the most important developments in new technology. The right therapeutic exercises and the objectivity of the evaluation of the range of motion (ROM; generated torque and muscular activation measurement of the patient) are extremely important factors during treatment. In this study, a lower limb rehabilitation robot was modified and controlled for upper limbs. The retro fitted robot system is able to do passive, active, and active-assistive therapeutic exercises. On the other hand, it performs active-assistive exercises using muscular activation. A web-based human machine interface, which can support home-care service, was developed to control the robotic system. This interface includes a performance evaluation unit, which is able to use not only ROM and torque, but also muscular activation of patients for the assessment of therapy results. Thanks to this system, assessment and physical therapy can be realized by a single robotic system for both upper and lower limbs using physical parameters such as ROM, generated torque, and muscular activation of the limbs. Satisfactory performance of the system is observed in the tests performed with a healthy subject.},

@article{Ustinova2006,
abstract = {Persistent motor deficits in the paretic arm present a major barrier to the recovery of the ability to perform bimanual tasks even in individuals who have recovered well after a stroke. Impaired performance may be related to deficits in bimanual temporal coordination due to stroke-related damage of specific brain motor structures as well as changed biomechanics of the paretic arm. To determine the extent of the deficit in bilateral temporal coordination after the stroke, we investigated how bilateral reciprocal coordination was regained after external perturbations of the arm in individuals with hemiparesis due to stroke. We used a bilateral task that would be minimally affected by the unilateral arm motor deficit. Nine non-disabled control subjects and 12 individuals with chronic hemiparesis performed reciprocal (anti-phase) arm swinging in the standing position for 15 s per trial. In each trial, movement of one arm was unexpectedly and transiently (∼ 150-350 ms) arrested at the level of the wrist once in the forward and once in the backward phase of swinging. Perturbation was applied to the left and right arms in control subjects and to the paretic and non-paretic arms of individuals with hemiparesis. Kinematic data from endpoint markers on both hands and electromyographic activity of anterior and posterior deltoid muscles from both arms were recorded. The oscillatory period, the phase differences between arms and the mean EMG activity before, during and after perturbation were analyzed. In both groups the perturbation altered the period of the perturbed cycle in both the arrested and non-arrested arms and resulted in a change from anti-phase to in-phase coordination, following which anti-phase coordination was regained. Recovery of anti-phase swinging took significantly longer in patients with hemiparesis compared to control subjects. Stable pre-perturbed (anti-phase) reciprocal coordination was regained within one cycle following perturbation for the control subjects and within two cycles following perturbation for the patients with hemiparesis. Analysis of EMG activation levels showed that, compared to control subjects, there was significantly less activation of the shoulder muscles in response to perturbation in the patient group and the pattern of muscle activation in the paretic arm was opposite to that in the non-paretic and control arms. The finding that patients had a reduced capacity for maintaining and restoring the required reciprocal coordination when perturbation occurred suggests that stroke-related brain damage in our patients led to instability of bilateral temporal coordination for this rhythmical task. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Objective: To classify and evaluate outcome measures currently used in robot-assisted exercise trials (RAET) in stroke, and to determine selection criteria for outcome measures in future trials. Methods: Outcome measures used in RAET were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed and PsychlNFO databases. The scale items were categorized into International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) domains. The psychometric properties of scale were rated using a standardized pro forma. Results: Thirty outcome measures were identified from 28 published RAET. Commonly used ICF body function scales were: Fugl-Meyer (FM) (24 studies), Modified Ashworth Scale (13 studies), Medical Research Council (11 studies), Kinematic measures (8 studies) and Motor Status Score (6 studies); ICF activity scale was Functional Independence Measure (FIMTM) (9 studies); ICF participation, personal and environmental factors scales were rarely used. Standard-ized rating identified that FM, kinematic measures, Action Research Arm Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, FIMTM, and ABILHAND have adequate measurement properties for use in RAET. Conclusion: Some of the currently used outcome measures seem appropriate for RAET. The use of the ICF framework enables selection of an appropriate combination of outcome measures depending on patient characteristics, such as severity of weakness and chronicity of stroke impairments. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

abstract = {In order to motivate the activity of patients in rehabilitation training, bimanual limb training has been applied widely in rehabilitation systems. Based on this point, we propose a self-controlled master-slave robot for upper limb rehabilitation. The system contains two identical motors with a wired-connection. Under the action of the external forces from the two limbs that attached to the master and slave sides, the motor exerted with a larger force works in generating state and acts as the master, while the other motor works in electro-motion state and acts as the slave. A certain amount of compensated energy, together with the recycled energy from the master, enables the slave to reproduce the master's movements accurately. The system realizes bilateral force sensing and supports different operating modes. Subjects coordinate the force of the two limbs based on visual feedback, further, controlling the handles in the two terminals to accomplish the predefined motion. Preliminary tests on different operating modes were conducted. The results confirm that the motion of the slave is precisely consistent with that of the master, and verify that the subjects can learn how to accomplish movements by practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

This meta-analysis aimed to compare the improvements in motor impairment and functional performances of people with stroke after BULT and UULT. Research design and methods This systematic review and meta-analysis identified 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the eligibility criteria from CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and PubMed. The outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and Box and Block Test (BBT), which are validated measures of upper limb function. Results Twenty-one studies involving 842 subjects with stroke were included. Compared with UULT, BULT yielded a significantly greater mean difference (MD) in the FMA-UE (MD = 2.21, 95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI), 0.12 to 4.30, p = 0.04; I2 = 86{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). However, a comparison of BULT and UULT yielded insignificant mean difference (MD) in terms of the time required to complete the WMFT (MD = 0.44; 95{\%}CI, -2.22 to 3.10, p = 0.75; I2 = 55{\%}, p = 0.06) and standard mean difference (SMD) in terms of the functional ability scores on the WMFT, ARAT and BBT (SMD = 0.25; 95{\%}CI, -0.02 to 0.52, p = 0.07; I2 = 54{\%}, p = 0.02). Discussion and implications Compared to UULT, BULT yielded superior improvements in the improving motor impairment of people with stroke, as measured by the FMA-UE. However, these strategies did not yield significant differences in terms of the functional performance of people with stroke, as measured by the WMFT, ARAT and BBT. More comparative studies of the effects of BULT and UULT are needed to increase the reliability of these conclusions.},

The knowledge of robot kinematics and dynamics is thus necessary to ensure haptic transparency and patient safety. The identification process of robot dynamics is emphasised and experimental identification results are given for the designed robot.

More recently, machine learning models have drawn attention and have established themselves as serious contenders to classical statistical models in the forecasting community. This chapter presents an overview of machine learning techniques in time series forecasting by focusing on three aspects: the formalization of one-step forecasting problems as supervised learning tasks, the discussion of local learning techniques as an effective tool for dealing with temporal data and the role of the forecasting strategy when we move from one-step to multiple-step forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: This paper suggests a pre-therapeutic device for post-stroke hemiplegic patients' wrist and finger rehabilitation both to decrease and analyze their muscle tones before the main physical or occupational therapy. Method/Statistical Analysis: We designed a robot which consists of a BLDC motor, a torque sensor, linear motion guides and bearings. Mechanical structure of the robot induces flexion and extension of wrist and finger (MCP) joints simultaneously with the single motor. The frames of the robot were 3D printed. During the flexion/extension exercise, angular position and repulsive torque of the joints are measured and displayed in real time. Findings: A prototype was 3D printed to conduct preliminary experiment on normal subject. From the neutral joint position (midway between extension and flexion), the robot rotated 120 degrees to extension direction and 30 degrees to flexion direction. First, the subject used the machine with the usual wrist and finger characteristics without any tones. Second, the same subject intentionally gave strength to the joints in order to imitate affected upper limb of a hemiplegic patient. During extension exercise, maximum repulsive torque of the normal hand was 2 Nm whereas that of the firm hand was almost 5 Nm. The result revealed that the device was capable enough to not only rotate rigid wrist and fingers with the novel robotic structure, but also present quantitative data such as the repulsive torque according to the joint orientation as an index of joint spasticity level. Improvements/Applications: We are planning to improve the system by applying torque control and arranging experiments at hospitals to obtain patients' data and feedbacks to meet actual needs in the field.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation is an active area of research to meet the demand of repetitive therapy in stroke rehabilitation. A wearable upper limb rehabilitation robot is most suitable for this task but needs to be powered by safe and compliant actuators while maintaining overall light weight and accommodating energy efficient dynamic form factor. In this study, we explore an integrative rehabilitation strategy for training patients to practice coordinated reaching and grasping functions by using a hybrid design to reduce the size and weight of the robot. The hybrid technology of the wearable upper limb rehabilitation robot and functional electrical stimulation has many technical and clinical advantages but is yet to be systematically investigated. A properly designed FES can induce active movements while inhibit abnormal reflexes. This is a promising approach to alleviate the actuation power demand of the robot, thereby the size and weight of the robot may be significantly reduced. Most important, the mechanical complexity of the robot may also be limited. We explored the concept of the hybrid design in this preliminary report. The future research is discussed for design principle of how to take advantage of each technique in developing a more energy efficient and functional effective hybrid FES and robot assisted system. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The population of disabled stroke survivors is increasing sharply over the world, and robot-assisted training has been proved to be effective to help motor relearning and alleviate the shortage of physical therapists. This paper presents the design details of a novel upper limb rehabilitation robot named CASIA-ARM, which can assist poststroke patients to perform shoulder and elbow rehabilitation training in the horizontal plane, and provide both force and visual feedback to the patient: 1) A five-bar closed-chain structure is designed to realize a stiff and low-inertial mechanism. Workspace and singularity analysis is given, which guarantees that the workspace is large enough for upper limb moving and no singularity in the workspace. 2) Cable transmission, motor current controller and impedance control method guarantee the transparent and compliant interaction between the human and the robot. 3) Implementation examples of passive training based on position control and active training based on impedance control are presented in detail. 4) In order to evaluate the robot's applicability and performance, examples of trajectory tracking and active reaching tasks are used in this study, and the preliminary test results are also given (tracking error: 0.86±0:42 mm, force control error: 1.41±0.79 N in the X direction, and 1.22±0.91 N in the Y direction).},

abstract = {Background: Abnormal synergy is one of the major motor deficits in stroke patients. Abnormal muscle synergies, in conjunction with weakness and spasticity, interfere with voluntary movements and restrict the range of motion. This study aimed to quantify abnormal synergies in the affected upper limbs of chronic stroke patients by using a neuro-rehabilitation robot. Methods: Twelve chronic stroke patients and eight age-matched control subjects were recruited to perform rectilinear tracking movements in four horizontal directions (back-forth, two oblique directions at 45°, and right-left). Kinematic, kinetic and electromyogram data were recorded and used to develop two biomechanical indices and one electromyogram assessment index based on principal component analysis. Findings: Significant differences between upper limbs of control subjects and the affected side of stroke patients were observed in all three assessment indices. Higher correlation between the elbow joint angle and the forearm pronation/supination torque, higher variation of the forearm torque, and abnormal co-contraction of the elbow and shoulder muscles were observed in the affected limbs of stroke patients. The difference was more prominent in the right-left direction and the oblique direction contra-proximal to ipsi-distal. Interpretation: The proposed assessment indices could be employed to quantify the abnormal synergies in stroke patients. Rectilinear tracking along the right-left direction and the oblique direction of contra-proximal to ipsi-distal is more suitable for assessing abnormal synergies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of disability among adults in the United States. Behaviors such as learned nonuse hinder hemiplegic stroke survivors from the full use of both arms in activities of daily living. Active force-feedback cues, designed to restrain the use of the less-affected arm, were embedded into a meaningful driving simulation environment to create robot-assisted therapy device, driver's simulation environment for arm therapy (SEAT). The study hypothesized that force-feedback control mode could "motivate" stroke survivors to increase the productive use of their impaired arm throughout a bilateral steering task, by providing motivating feedback and reinforcement cues to reduce the overuse of the less-affected arm. Experimental results demonstrate that the force cues counteracted the tendency of hemiplegic subjects to produce counter-productive torques only during bilateral steering tasks (p {\textless} 0.05) that required the movement of their impaired arm in steering directions up and against gravity. Impaired arm activity was quantified in terms of torques due to the measured tangential forces on the split-steering wheel of driver's SEAT during bilateral steering. Results were verified using surface electromyograms recorded from key muscles in the impaired arm. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

However, with further development of therapy strategies in the last few years, higher request to the rehabilitation robot has been put forward. Thus, we are developing a novel hand rehabilitation robot named HIT-glove to provide patient-cooperative therapy for hand-impaired post-stroke patients. In this paper, the mechanical design of the actuated hand exoskeleton is detailed and the control strategy for patient-cooperative therapy is introduced. The actuated hand exoskeleton, which can be applied to hands in different sizes and shapes, is able to bilaterally actuate every joint of the fingers. The patient-cooperative control strategy, based on the sensing system and an interactive interface, is well designed to let the patient actively participate into the therapy. Besides, to get a better effect of functional rehabilitation of the hand, our robot is expected to provide the following two categories of therapy: motor function exercise for joints and movement coordination training for fingers. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The robotic device are designed with applications of techniques to support the adaptive exercise possible. It can apply to repeat the process exercise as many times as you wish. Moreover, the data measurements of their improvement or decline can be analyzed through the sensors on the device. This paper proposes a specially designed force sensorless bilateral control based on Kalman-Filter Based State Observer (KFSO) for the hand and the wrist of the patient. By using KFSO, it can be applied to estimate a high bandwidth force sensation and good perception of an unknown environmental stiffness. Moreover, bilateral control based on the shadow mode and mirror mode is also proposed in order to improve human hand movement. To successfully implement neuro-recovery process, the mirror mode is proposed to help the brain into thinking the weaker hand or wrist is moving according to the stronger hand or wrist. With such a robust bilateral control scheme, significant high bandwidth haptic sensing in a rehabilitation robot can be achieved. The simulation results of the rehabilitation robot are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

We exemplify the approach using runoff simulations from five GHMs across 40 large global catchments. The benchmarked, median performance gain of the MMC solutions is 45{\%} compared to the best performing GHM and exceeds 100{\%} when compared to the ensemble mean (EM). The performance gain offered by MMC suggests that future multi-model applications consider reporting MMCs, alongside the EM and intermodal range, to provide end-users of GHM ensembles with a better contextualised estimate of runoff. Importantly, the study highlights the difficulty of interpreting complex, non-linear MMC solutions in physical terms. This indicates that a pragmatic approach to future MMC studies based on machine learning methods is required, in which the allowable solution complexity is carefully constrained.},

Participants in the URTP and BRTP groups practiced forearm pronation and supination and wrist flexion and extension in a simultaneous manner with the Bi-Manu-Track. The control group received standard rehabilitation. Clinical measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Medical Research Council instrument, grip strength, and the Modified Ashworth Scale to assess motor impairment, muscle power, muscle strength, and spasticity, respectively.

abstract = {Background and Purpose - Chronic upper extremity hemiparesis is a leading cause of functional disability after stroke. We investigated the hypothesis that bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) will improve motor function in the hemiparetic arm of stroke patients. Methods - In this single group pilot study we determined the effects of 6 weeks of BATRAC on 14 patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke (median time after stroke, 30 months) immediately after training and at 2 months after training. Four 5-minute periods per session (3 times per week) of BATRAC were performed with the use of a custom-designed arm training machine. Results - The patients showed significant and potentially durable increases in the following: Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Performance Test of impairment (P{\textless}0.0004), Wolf Motor Function Test (performance time measure, P{\textless}0.02), and University of Maryland Arm Questionnaire for Stroke measuring daily use of the hemiparetic arm (P{\textless}0.002). Isometric strength improved in elbow flexion (P{\textless}0.05) and wrist flexion (P{\textless}0.02) for the paretic arm and in elbow flexion (P{\textless}0.02) and wrist extension (P{\textless}0.02) for the nonparetic arm. Active range of motion improved for paretic-side shoulder extension (P{\textless}0.01), wrist flexion (P{\textless}0.004), and thumb opposition (P{\textless}0.002), and passive range of motion improved for paretic wrist flexion (P{\textless}0.03). Conclusions - Six weeks of BATRAC improves functional motor performance of the paretic upper extremity as well as a few changes in isometric strength and range of motion. These benefits are largely sustained at 8 weeks after training cessation.},

abstract = {Robot therapy seems promising with stroke survivors, but it is unclear which exercises are most effective, and whether other pathologies may benefit from this technique. In general, exercises should exploit the adaptive nature of the nervous system, even in chronic patients. Ideally, exercise should involve multiple sensory modalities and, to promote active subject participation, the level of assistance should be kept to a minimum. Moreover, exercises should be tailored to the different degrees of impairment, and should adapt to changing performance. To this end, we designed three tasks: (i) a hitting task, aimed at improving the ability to perform extension movements; (ii) a tracking task, aimed at improving visuo-motor control; and (iii) a bimanual task, aimed at fostering inter-limb coordination. All exercises are conducted on a planar manipulandum with two degrees of freedom, and involve alternating blocks of exercises performed with and without vision. The degree of assistance is kept to a minimum, and adjusted to the changing subject's performance. All three exercises were tested on chronic stroke survivors with different levels of impairment. During the course of each exercise, movements became faster, smoother, more precise, and required decreasing levels of assistive force. These results point to the potential benefit of that assist-as-needed training with a proprioceptive component in a variety of clinical conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

abstract = {Objective: A review of the basic concepts of stroke rehabilitation that are worth emphasizing to all practitioners who treat patients with stroke. Also, suggestions are made for patients on how to functionally cope with daily activities after they have experienced a stroke. Methods: Numerous articles that discuss stroke rehabilitation and recovery were reviewed and emphasized throughout this paper. Results: The multidisciplinary approach of incorporating expertise from the realms of physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy along with optimal medical care continues to be viewed as advantageous. Coordination by a physician with expertise in neurorehabilitation is also an important aspect of successful stroke rehabilitation. Such expertise takes the form of realistic expectations about recovery based upon performance of serial functional assessment scales, knowledge about the size and location of the stroke or strokes, incorporation of any cognitive or emotional detriments to recovery, as well as acknowledgement of medical comorbid factors. The care plan must also institute effective measures to protect against recurrent stroke, as stroke patients are generally at significant risk for further ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Conclusion: Stroke rehabilitation should begin during the patient's hospital admission. Obviously, the degree of recovery is impacted by the age of the patient, the magnitude of the initial deficit, the medical condition of the patient, the motivation of the patient and family members, the risk of recurrent stroke as well as the quality of the stroke rehabilitation process. There are numerous assistive devices available to stroke patients that can help them adjust to their new post-stroke lifestyle. {\textcopyright} 2009 W. S. Maney {\&} Son Ltd.},

abstract = {Bilateral rehabilitation training has been proposed to help patients of hemiplegia who have partial impairment of the upper limb to regain the ability of daily living (ADL). In this paper, a bilateral training method by means of a novel power-assist exoskeleton device is presented to help post-stroke patients to improve rehabilitation effects. In order to provide appropriate power assistance during home-based rehabilitation, a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) was applied to regulate the output stiffness of the exoskeleton device. This paper presents the performance evaluation of the integrated VSA. The results related to the performance demonstrated that high stiffness could rapidly force the elbow joint to the initial equilibrium position to ensure precise trajectory movement, while low stiffness could allow relatively large deviations from the desired trajectory thus inherently guaranteeing the patient's safety. In addition, a preliminary elbow rehabilitation trial is performed to evaluate the proposed bilateral rehabilitation strategy.

abstract = {Chang J-J, Tung W-L, Wu W-L, Huang M-H, Su F-C. Effects of robot-aided bilateral force-induced arm training combined with conventional rehabilitation on arm motor function in patients with chronic stroke. Objective: To analyze the effects of conventional rehabilitation combined with bilateral force-induced isokinetic arm movement training on paretic upper-limb motor recovery in patients with chronic stroke. Design: Single-cohort, pre- and postretention design. Setting: Rehabilitation department at a medical university. Participants: Twenty subjects who had unilateral strokes at least 6 months before enrolling in the study. Intervention: A training program (40min/session, 3 sessions/wk for 8wk) consisting of 10 minutes of conventional rehabilitation and 30 minutes of robot-aided, bilateral force-induced, isokinetic arm movement training to improve paretic upper-limb motor function. Main Outcome Measures: The interval of pretest, post-test, and retention test was set at 8 weeks. Clinical arm motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA], upper-limb motor function, Frenchay Arm Test, Modified Ashworth Scale), paretic upper-limb strength (grip strength, arm push and pull strength), and reaching kinematics analysis (peak velocity, percentage of time to peak velocity, movement time, normalized jerk score) were used as outcome measures. Results: After comparing the sets of scores, we found that the post-test and retention test in arm motor function significantly improved in terms of grip (P=.009), push (P=.001), and pull (P=.001) strengths, and FMA upper-limb scale (P{\textless}.001). Reaching kinematics significantly improved in terms of movement time (P=.015), peak velocity (P=.035), percentage of time to peak velocity (P=.004), and normalized jerk score (P=.008). Improvement in reaching ability was not sustained in the retention test. Conclusions: Preliminary results showed that conventional rehabilitation combined with robot-aided, bilateral force-induced, isokinetic arm training might enhance the recovery of strength and motor control ability in the paretic upper limb of patients with chronic stroke. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the therapeutic interventions reported in the research literature and synthesize their effectiveness in improving upper limb (UL) function in the first 4 weeks poststroke. Data Sources: Electronic databases and trial registries were searched from inception until June 2016, in addition to searching systematic reviews by hand. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials, and interventional studies with pre/posttest design were included for adults within 4 weeks of any type of stroke with UL impairment. Participants all received an intervention of any physiotherapeutic or occupational therapeutic technique designed to address impairment or activity of the affected UL, which could be compared with usual care, sham, or another technique. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of full texts, and methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data Synthesis: A total of 104 trials (83 RCTs, 21 nonrandomized studies) were included (N=5225 participants). Meta-analyses of RCTs only (20 comparisons) and narrative syntheses were completed. Key findings included significant positive effects for modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) (standardized mean difference [SMD]=1.09; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI],.21–1.97) and task-specific training (SMD=.37; 95{\%} CI,.05–.68). Evidence was found to support supplementary use of biofeedback and electrical stimulation. Use of Bobath therapy was not supported. Conclusions: Use of mCIMT and task-specific training was supported, as was supplementary use of biofeedback and electrical simulation, within the acute phase poststroke. Further high-quality studies into the initial 4 weeks poststroke are needed to determine therapies for targeted functional UL outcomes.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether paretic arm reaching performance is improved in bilateral compared with unilateral conditions. Design: Cohort study. Setting: University human performance laboratory. Participants: Thirty-two subjects with chronic stroke (57±14y; on Fugl-Meyer Assessment arm score, 37±14). Intervention: Unilateral and bilateral reaching. Bilateral tasks included varying levels of weight on the nonparetic hand. Main Outcome Measures: An electromagnetic tracking system recorded hand peak acceleration, velocity, and movement time. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the results ($\alpha$=.05). Results: Paretic differed significantly from nonparetic peak acceleration and velocity in unilateral reaching but not bilateral reaching. Within limbs, the paretic arm attained a higher peak acceleration (P{\textless}.001) and velocity (P=.03) in the bilateral compared with the unilateral task, but movement time was unchanged between tasks. Nonparetic peak acceleration was higher (P=.015), velocity was unchanged, and movement time increased (P=.005) in the bilateral compared with the unilateral task. The addition of a weight to the nonparetic arm during bilateral reaching did not result in further improvement in paretic arm performance. Conclusions: Interlimb coupling effects during bilateral reaching are retained even after chronic stroke and can be used to produce an immediate improvement in paretic arm reaching performance. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Nonhuman primate models of poststroke recovery have become increasingly rare primarily due to high purchase and maintenance costs and limited availability of nonhuman primate species. Despite this obstacle, nonhuman primate models may offer important advantages over rodent models for understanding many of the brain's mechanisms for self-repair due to greater similarity in cortical organization to humans. Since the mid-1990s, surgical, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods have been developed to understand structural and functional remodeling of the cerebral cortex after an ischemic event, such as occurs in stroke. These methods require long surgical procedures and entail constant physiological monitoring. With careful attention to intraoperative and postsurgical monitoring, these procedures can be repeated multiple times in individual monkeys without untoward events. This model provides a statistically powerful approach for tracking brain plasticity in the ensuing weeks and months after a stroke-like injury, reducing the number of animals required for individual experiments. This methodology is described in detail, and many of the resulting findings that are relevant for understanding stroke recovery and the effects of rehabilitative and pharmacotherapeutic interventions are summarized.},

A kind of light, back-drivable and safe one degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robot with low cost is designed, and a safe control strategy which is combination of PI control and damping control is proposed for the robot control. Through this telerehabilitation robot system, a therapist can dialogue with post-stroke patients in video communication via the networks, and then he can remotely set or modify the training mode and control parameters of the rehabilitation robots for post-stroke patient training. Haptic based therapy game is also programmed to improve the activity of the patients during training process. Integrated with database management, the history and current performance data of patients acquired by all sensors of the telerehabilitation robot system during the training process are stored and managed. Three volunteer individual patients with upper limb disabilities participated in this study. After four weeks of periodic rehabilitation training with the telerehabilitation robot system, the muscle strength and movement coordination of the three patients had been obviously improved. Our study shows that the one-therapist to three-patient telerehabilitation robot system has good reliability and is able to greatly improve efficiency of the rehabilitation training, which can solve the problem of lack of therapist to a certain extent.},

Clinical observations prompted investigation of a novel approach using simultaneous identical bilateral movements performed independently. We briefly report 12 controlled single-case experiments using multiple-baseline designs across three separate grasp/reach activities. Unilateral performance tests with the hemiplegic arm using the bilaterally trained actions demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in movement patterns. These improvements were specific to the trained movement and well maintained. Using recent literature we develop a theoretical model proposing that bilateral simultaneous movement promotes interhemispheric disinhibition likely to allow reorganization by sharing of normal movement commands from the undamaged hemisphere. Disinhibition may also encourage recruitment of undamaged neurones to construct new task-relevant neural networks. The potential contribution of spared ipsilateral pathways in the damaged hemisphere, indirect corticospinal pathways and ipsilateral pathways from the undamaged hemisphere is discussed.},

However, several recent studies have suggested that this phenomenon might be utilized in the rehabilitation of individuals with motor disability due to unilateral brain injury. In this paper the efficacy of such a rehabilitative approach is explored by reviewing: (i) examples of symmetry tendencies in healthy individuals, (ii) the potential neurophysiological mechanisms responsible for inter-limb coupling, and (iii) recent studies which have directly assessed the effects of inter-limb coupling on individuals with unilateral brain injury. Method. A thorough review of current published evidence was conducted utilizing various electronic search engines (Medline, PreMedline, Embase and Cinahl). Studies included those that focused on symmetry tendencies and/or inter-limb coupling in the upper limbs with a particular emphasis placed on studies of individuals with unilateral brain injury. Results. Based on the current literature it seems that motor function of the affected upper limb in individuals with unilateral brain injury can be improved through a rehabilitation approach that incorporates inter-limb coupling. Conclusion. This approach should be considered as an adjunct to more common rehabilitation strategies with future research aimed at determining the most effective means of employing this paradigm.},

abstract = {Recent neurological research indicates that the impaired motor skills of post-stroke patients can be enhanced and possibly restored through task-oriented repetitive training. This is due to neuroplasticity – the ability of the brain to change through adulthood. Various rehabilitation processes have been developed to take advantage of neuroplasticity to retrain neural pathways and restore or improve motor skills lost as a result of stroke or spinal cord injuries (SCI). Research in this area over the last few decades has resulted in a better understanding of the dynamics of rehabilitation in post-stroke patients and development of auxiliary devices and tools to induce repeated targeted body movements. With the growing number of stroke rehabilitation therapies, the application of robotics within the rehabilitation process has received much attention. As such, numerous mechanical and robot-assisted upper limb and hand function training devices have been proposed. A systematic review of robotic-assisted upper extremity (UE) motion rehabilitation therapies was carried out in this study. The strengths and limitations of each method and its effectiveness in arm and hand function recovery were evaluated. The study provides a comparative analysis of the latest developments and trends in this field, and assists in identifying research gaps and potential future work.},

Two chronic stroke survivors experienced task-oriented robot assisted therapy, in which the paretic arm was trained using reaching and grasping tasks over 4 weeks. Both subjects experienced improvement in motor control as measured by Fugl-Meyer. The paretic arm was evaluated using movement smoothness (MS) and time to completion (TCT) measures before and after therapy. From the results, we found that the unilateral robotassisted training improved paretic arm control in the unilateral and the bilateral drink task. However, the influence of the non-paretic movement on the temporal and spatial paretic arm control was evident both pre and post therapy suggesting inter-limb coupling aids in the transfer of unilateral improvements in motor control to improvements in bilateral motor control.},

It is suggested that the SMA has an important role to play in the intentional process whereby internal context influences the elaboration of action. It may be viewed as phylogenetically older motor cortex, derived from anterior cingulate periarchicortical limbic cortex, which, as a key part of a medial premotor system, is crucial in the “programming” and fluent execution of extended action sequences which are “projectional” in that they rely on model-based prediction. This medial system can be distinguished from a lateral premotor system postulated to have evolved over phylogeny from a different neural source. An anatomico-physiologic model of the medial premotor system is proposed which embodies the principles of cyclicity and reentrance in the process of selecting those neural components to become active in conjunction with the performance of a particular action. The postulated dynamic action of this model in the microgenesis of a discrete action is outlined. It is concluded that although there is a great deal to be learned about the SMA, a convergence of current evidence can be identified. Such evidence suggests that the SMA plays an important role in the development of the intention-to-act and the specification and elaboration of action through its mediation between medial limbic cortex and primary motor cortex. {\textcopyright} 1985, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Drinking water supplies of 161 rural communities, in Georgetown County, South Carolina, were randomly selected for sample collection. The analysis showed that most of the waters were slightly acidic. Low, but acceptable concentrations of chloride, copper, fluoride, sodium, cadmium, nitrate and phosphate were found. A few water samples showed higher then recommended levels of arsenic, mercury, zinc and lead. Although only 2{\%} of the samples exceeded the mandatory limit of 0.05 ppm for arsenic, 72{\%} exceeded the recommended level of 0.01 ppm. The mandatory limit for manganese was exceeded in 37{\%} of the waters while 88{\%} exceeded the limit for iron. The high iron content was generally responsible for the high turbidity found in 45{\%} of the samples. The well depth and the consumer income had some bearing on water quality. Statistical evidence suggested that septic tank seepage was partially responsible for nitrate, phsophate, iron and arsenic contamination of shallow water supplies. Lead concentrations appear to vary according to the plumbing used and the pH of the waters. {\textcopyright} 1975 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

The vector-valued variant is developed by extending the notions of the estimator, loss function and regularization functional from the scalar-valued case. A particular emphasis is placed on the class of loss functions chosen which apply the $\epsilon$-insensitive loss function to the p-norm of the error. The primal and dual optimization problems are derived and the KKT conditions are developed. The general case for the p-norm is specialized for the 1-, 2-and ∞-norms. It is shown that the vector-valued variant is a true extension of the scalar-valued case. It is then shown that the vector-valued approach results in sparse representations in terms of support vectors as compared to aggregated scalar-valued learning.},

We tested a modified form of BATRAC (modBATRAC) in a new group of participants with a condensed treatment regime to determine whether we could replicate these reported results. Methods. Fourteen subjects with chronic stroke completed 2 weeks of 2.25 hours per session, 4 sessions per week of modBATRAC. Results. No significant changes were observed in UE Fugl-Meyer or Wolf Motor Function Test scores. Subjects did report increased paretic UE use on the Motor Activity Log (mean change, 0.50; SD = 0.70). Conclusions. The results of this study offer only partial support for the efficacy of modBATRAC. As in previous trials, modBATRAC facilitated increased use of the paretic arm, but unlike previous trials, it did not increase motor performance. These differences may reflect a more temporally condensed training schedule and less impaired patients. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

abstract = {Morris JH, van Wijck F, Joice S, Ogston SA, Cole I, MacWalter RS. A comparison of bilateral and unilateral upper-limb task training in early poststroke rehabilitation: a randomized controlled trial. Objective: To compare the effects of bilateral task training with unilateral task training on upper-limb outcomes in early poststroke rehabilitation. Design: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial, with outcome assessments at baseline, postintervention (6wk), and follow-up (18wk). Setting: Inpatient acute and rehabilitation hospitals. Participants: Patients were randomized to receive bilateral training (n=56) or unilateral training (n=50) at 2 to 4 weeks poststroke onset. Intervention: Supervised bilateral or unilateral training for 20 minutes on weekdays over 6 weeks using a standardized program. Main Outcome Measures: Upper-limb outcomes were assessed by Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Rivermead Motor Assessment upper-limb scale, and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Secondary measures included the Modified Barthel Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Nottingham Health Profile. All assessment was conducted by a blinded assessor. Results: No significant differences were found in short-term improvement (0-6wk) on any measure (P{\textgreater}.05). For overall improvement (0-18wk), the only significant between-group difference was a change in the 9HPT (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.0-0.1; P=.05) and ARAT pinch section (95{\%} CI, 0.3-5.6; P=.03), which was lower for the bilateral training group. Baseline severity significantly influenced improvement in all upper-limb outcomes (P{\textless}.05), but this was irrespective of the treatment group. Conclusions: Bilateral training was no more effective than unilateral training, and in terms of overall improvement in dexterity, the bilateral training group improved significantly less. Intervention timing, task characteristics, dose, and intensity of training may have influenced the results and are therefore areas for future investigation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Patients with moderate to severe hemiparesis following stroke often show abnormal muscle coactivation and a loss of interjoint coordination in the hemiparetic limb. These abnormal stereotypic movement patterns are known in clinical rehabilitation as abnormal secondary torques or synergies. In the beginning of a rehabilitation process the patients often train inside those synergistic patterns, what helps to restore some functionality, but makes it more difficult to break out of them later. Preliminary tests in our lab showed, that there is no precise test to characterize short term alteration in abnormal coupling between different joints. Therefore, a new assessment tool has been developed and implemented on the arm rehabilitation robot ARMin. A special synergy training program has been assembled and evaluated with one patient. The new assessment method showed to be appropriate for a qualitative measurement of abnormal couplings. After training, the patient's dominant synergy pattern were reduced. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

Fourteen participants received a control treatment, followed by a washout period, and then the intervention. The intervention comprised playing computer games with the CyWee Z (CyWee Group Ltd; Taipei, Taiwan), a movement-based game controller similar to the Nintendo Wii remote. The CyWee Z was incorporated into a handlebar, making bilateral exercises possible by allowing the unaffected side to support and assist the affected side. The intervention lasted for 8 to 10 sessions of 45 to 60 minutes over a period of 2.5 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper-limb section (FMA-UL) was used as the primary outcome. The Wolf Motor Function Test and the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcome measure were used as secondary outcomes. Postintervention, motor performance as measured by the FMA-UL was significantly improved compared with all preintervention assessments (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas no changes were found on both secondary outcomes. It can be concluded from this pilot study that upper-limb motor performance of adults with chronic stroke improves with repetitive, game-assisted, self-supported bilateral exercises.},

Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Seven patients who experienced stroke {\textgreater}1 year prior to study entry exhibiting affected leg weakness. Intervention: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive both of the following in a randomized, sequential order: (a) a resistance-based, reciprocal, affected leg locomotor training protocol using the NuStep apparatus (n = 4) and (b) a home exercise programme (HEP) consisting of self-supervised practice with fractionated joint movements of the lower limb. Each phase of the intervention was performed for 30 minutes each session, three days a week, and conducted over an eight-week period. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were evaluated by a blinded rater using the lower extremity scale of the Fugl-Meyer and the Berg Balance Scale. Results: After HEP participation, subjects showed nominal or no changes on any of the outcome measures. After NuStep participation, patients in both treatment groups showed impairment reductions as shown by the Fugl-Meyer (+4.3; +2.2), and increased balance as shown by the Berg Balance Scale (+4.0; +4.0). These trends were exhibited regardless of group assignment.

abstract = {Upper extremity (UE) hemiparesis results in decreased movement speed and impaired coordination leading to functional limitations and disability. The effects of UE hemiparesis on bilateral functional reaching have not been studied even though most activities of daily living are bilateral tasks. We examined the characteristics of bilateral simultaneous (SIM-B) and bilateral sequential paretic-lead (SEQ-P) and nonparetic-lead (SEQ-NP) functional reaching tasks at preferred and fast speeds. Sixteen patients with chronic hemiparesis completed three bilateral reaching tasks as fast as possible. A subset of eight participants attempted to complete the tasks at both preferred and fastest possible speeds. Paretic (P) and nonparetic (NP) arms were not different from each other in movement time (MT) or peak velocity in the SIM-B condition. MT and peak velocity differed between the two arms during both SEQ tasks. P MT was shorter and NP MT longer in the SIM-B task compared to SEQ-P and SEQ-NP. The P arm MT was the shortest when moving with the NP arm in a simultaneous task compared to both P and NP lead sequential movements. Despite hemiparesis, the two arms demonstrate a temporal coupling when moving simultaneously. When attempting to move at fastest speed, P arm MT time is better when reaching before or with the NP arm than when reaching after the NP arm showing coupling to the NP limb and increased speed of movement. These coupling effects support the rationale for bilateral arm training for individuals with UE hemiparesis. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

The objective was to compare the training effects of treatments on the wrist joint of subjects with chronic stroke with an interactive rehabilitation robot and a robot with continuous passive motion. Methods. This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with a 3-month follow-up. Twenty-seven hemiplegic subjects with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to receive 20-session wrist training with a continuous electromyography (EMG)-driven robot (interactive group, n = 15) and a passive motion device (passive group, n = 12), completed within 7 consecutive weeks. Training effects were evaluated with clinical scores by pretraining and posttraining tests (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA] and Modified Ashworth Score [MAS]) and with session-by-session EMG parameters (EMG activation level and co-contraction index). Results.ificant improvements in FMA scores (shoulder/elbow and wrist/hand) were found in the interactive group (P {\textless}.05).ificant decreases in the MAS were observed in the wrist and elbow joints for the interactive group and in the wrist joint for the passive group (P {\textless}.05). These MAS changes were associated with the decrease in EMG activation level of the flexor carpi radialis and the biceps brachii for the interactive group (P {\textless}.05). The muscle coordination on wrist and elbow joints was improved in the interactive groups in the EMG co-contraction indexes across the training sessions (P {\textless}.05). Conclusions. The interactive treatment improved muscle coordination and reduced spasticity after the training for both the wrist and elbow joints, which persisted for 3 months. The passive mode training mainly reduced the spasticity in the wrist flexor.},

abstract = {To facilitate learning in a target domain, transfer learning borrows knowledge from a source domain. What and how to transfer are two main issues that need to be addressed in transferring learning. Different transfer learning algorithms result in different knowledge transferred between them for a couple of domains. To find the optimal transfer learning algorithm that maximizes learning efficiency in the target domain, scientists need to investigate all current computationally intractable transfer learning algorithms exhaustively. A sub-optimal algorithm is selected as a trade-off, which in an ad hoc way requires considerable expertise. In instructional psychology, meanwhile, it is commonly recognized that people enhance the transfer of teaching abilities to decide what to transfer. This paper discusses what is transfer learning, the different transfer learning techniques, future scope, and applications of it.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate progress toward motor recovery in patients with chronic hemiparesis (mean time since stroke 3.2 years), comparing different types of practice schedules. Design: To increase voluntary control of the upper extremity, active neuromuscular stimulation was administered during blocked and random practice schedules as patients performed three specific movements: wrist/finger extension, elbow joint extension, and shoulder joint abduction. Methods: 34 stroke subjects volunteered to participate and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: blocked practice (the same movement was repetitively performed on successive trials) combined with active neuromuscular stimulation; random practice (different movements on successive trials) along with active stimulation; or no active stimulation assistance control group. Subjects completed two days of 90 minute training for each of two weeks with at least 24 hours of rest between sessions. A session was three sets of 30 successful active neuromuscular stimulation trials with the three movements executed 10 times/set. Results: Mixed design analyses on three categories of behavioural measures indicated motor improvements for the blocked and random practice/stimulation groups in comparison with the control group during the post-test period, with a larger number of blocks moved, faster premotor and motor reaction times, and less variability in the sustained muscular controction task. Conclusions: Upper extremity rehabilitation intervention of active stimulation and blocked practice performed as well as stimulation/random practice. Moreover, these purposeful voluntary movement findings support and extend sensorimotor integration theory to both practice schedules.},

One aspect that must be fulfilled by such robots, is the need to handle uncertainties due to biomechanical variation of different patients, without significantly degrading performance. Currently, rehabilitation robots require re-tuning of controller gain for each individual. This is time consuming process and requires expert training. To overcome this problem, we propose robust sliding mode control algorithm, which uses very basic information of subject like weight, height, age and gender to handle these model uncertainties. For analysis, we have compared our proposed algorithm with Robust Computed Torque Control (RCTC) and Boundary Augmented Sliding Mode Control (BASMC) algorithms with diverse subjects. Results describe the superiority of the proposed algorithm in handling uncertain parameters human arm and robot without degrading the performance.},

abstract = {In the context of stroke rehabilitation, simple structures and user-intent driven actuation are relevant features to facilitate neuroplasticity as well as deliver a sufficient number of repetitions during a single therapy session. A novel robotic treatment device for distal upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients was developed, and a usability test was performed to assess its clinical feasibility. The rehabilitation robot was designed as a two-axis exoskeleton actuated by electric motors, consisting of forearm supination/pronation and hand grasp/release, which were selected based on a kinematic analysis of essential daily activities. A vision-assisted algorithm was utilized for user-intent extraction in a human-in-the-loop concept. A usability test was performed on six physiatrists, five biomedical engineers, five rehabilitation therapists, two chronic stroke patients, and two caregivers of the patients. After sufficient instruction, all subjects tested the robot for a minimum of 10 min and completed the evaluation form using a 7-point Likert scale. The participants found the device interesting (5.7 ± 1.2), motivating (5.8 ± 0.9), and as having less possibility of causing injury or safety issues (6.1 ± 1.1); however, the appropriateness of difficulty (4.8 ± 1.9) and comfort level (4.9 ± 1.3) were found to be relatively low. Further development of the current device would provide a good treatment option as a simple, low-cost, and clinically feasible rehabilitation robot for stroke.},

@article{Schabowsky2010,
abstract = {Background. Following acute therapeutic interventions, the majority of stroke survivors are left with a poorly functioning hemiparetic hand. Rehabilitation robotics has shown promise in providing patients with intensive therapy leading to functional gains. Because of the hand's crucial role in performing activities of daily living, attention to hand therapy has recently increased. Methods. This paper introduces a newly developed Hand Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot (HEXORR). This device has been designed to provide full range of motion (ROM) for all of the hand's digits. The thumb actuator allows for variable thumb plane of motion to incorporate different degrees of extension/flexion and abduction/adduction. Compensation algorithms have been developed to improve the exoskeleton's backdrivability by counteracting gravity, stiction and kinetic friction. We have also designed a force assistance mode that provides extension assistance based on each individual's needs. A pilot study was conducted on 9 unimpaired and 5 chronic stroke subjects to investigate the device's ability to allow physiologically accurate hand movements throughout the full ROM. The study also tested the efficacy of the force assistance mode with the goal of increasing stroke subjects' active ROM while still requiring active extension torque on the part of the subject. Results. For 12 of the hand digits'15 joints in neurologically normal subjects, there were no significant ROM differences (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between active movements performed inside and outside of HEXORR. Interjoint coordination was examined in the 1 st and 3rd digits, and no differences were found between inside and outside of the device (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Stroke subjects were capable of performing free hand movements inside of the exoskeleton and the force assistance mode was successful in increasing active ROM by 43 ± 5{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001) and 24 ± 6{\%} (P = 0.041) for the fingers and thumb, respectively. Conclusions. Our pilot study shows that this device is capable of moving the hand's digits through nearly the entire ROM with physiologically accurate trajectories. Stroke subjects received the device intervention well and device impedance was minimized so that subjects could freely extend and flex their digits inside of HEXORR. Our active force-assisted condition was successful in increasing the subjects' ROM while promoting active participation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Schabowsky et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Control system implementation is one of the major difficulties in rehabilitation robot design. The purpose of our study is to present newly developed control strategies for an upper-limb rehabilitation robot. The Barrett WAM Arm manipulator is used as the main hardware platform for the functional recovery training of the past-stroke patient. Passive and active recovery training have been implemented on the WAM Arm. A fuzzy-based PD position control strategy is proposed for the passive recovery exercise to control the WAM Arm stably and smoothly to stretch the impaired limb to move along predefined trajectories. An adaptive impedance force controller is employed in the active motion mode in which a fuzzy logic regulator is used to adjust the desired impedance between the robot and impaired limb to generate adaptive force in agreement with the change of the impaired limb's muscle strength. In order to evaluate the change of the impaired limb's muscle power, the impaired limb's mechanical impedance parameters as an objective evaluation index is estimated online by using a recursive least-squares algorithm with an adaptive forgetting factor. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 VSP.},

abstract = {Traditional machine learning algorithms have made great achievements in data-driven fault diagnosis. However, they assume that all the data must be in the same working condition and have the same distribution and feature space. They are not applicable for real-world working conditions, which often change with time, so the data are hard to obtain. In order to utilize data in different working conditions to improve the performance, this paper presents a transfer learning approach for fault diagnosis with neural networks. First, it learns characteristics from massive source data and adjusts the parameters of neural networks accordingly. Second, the structure of neural networks alters for the change of data distribution. In the same time, some parameters are transferred from source task to target task. Finally, the new model is trained by a small amount of target data in another working condition. The Case Western Reserve University bearing data set is used to validate the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach. Experimental results show that the proposed transfer learning approach can improve the classification accuracy and reduce the training time comparing with the conventional neural network method when there are only a small amount of target data.},

abstract = {Background: Hand rehabilitation is core to helping stroke survivors regain activities of daily living. Recent studies have suggested that the use of electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) can promote this process. Here, we report the first systematic examination of the literature on the use of BCI-robot systems for the rehabilitation of fine motor skills associated with hand movement and profile these systems from a technical and clinical perspective. Methods: A search for January 2010-October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation at different stages of development involving tests on healthy participants or people who have had a stroke. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. Results: 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for three BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. Conclusion: 19 out of 30 studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre-clinical stages of development. Three studies report statistically significant improvements in functional recovery after stroke, but there is a need to develop a standard protocol for assessing technical and clinical outcomes so that the necessary evidence base on efficiency and efficacy can be developed.},

abstract = {Background. Bilateral training in poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation is based on the premise that simultaneous movements of the nonparetic upper limb facilitate performance and recovery of paretic upper-limb function through neural coupling effects. Objective. To determine whether the degree of coupling between both hands is higher after bilateral than after unilateral training and control treatment. Methods. In a single-blinded randomized controlled trial, we investigated rhythmic interlimb coordination after unilateral (mCIMT) and bilateral (mBATRAC) upper-limb training and a dose-matched control treatment (DMCT) in 60 patients suffering from stroke. To this end, we used a series of tasks to discern intended and unintended coupling effects between the hands. In addition, we investigated the control over the paretic hand as reflected by movement harmonicity and amplitude. All tasks were performed before and after a 6-week intervention period and at follow-up 6 weeks later. Results. There were no significant between-group differences in change scores from baseline to postintervention and from postintervention to follow-up with regard to interlimb coupling. However, the mBATRAC group showed greater movement harmonicity and larger amplitudes with the paretic hand after training than the mCIMT and DMCT groups. Conclusions. The degree of coupling between both hands was not significantly higher after bilateral than after unilateral training and control treatment. Although improvements in movement harmonicity and amplitude following mBATRAC may indicate a beneficial influence of the interlimb coupling, those effects were more likely due to the particular type of limb movements employed during this training protocol.},

A series of 20 tests, carried out under nominally identical conditions, was performed using a reciprocating pin-on-disk tribometer. A comparison between the experimental standard deviation and uncertainty analysis results is provided. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 by ASME.},

abstract = {Restoration of motor function is a priority of post-stroke rehabilitation, the aim being to facilitate the patient's reintegration into society. Innovative technologies for neurological rehabilitation must be easy to use and offer patients real benefits, and the treatments they provide must be efficacious and efficient. All these aspects must be carefully evaluated in their development. To achieve restoration of motor function after stroke, task-specific repetitive robot-assisted training of the upper and the lower extremity is currently the most promising approach. The results of clinical trials of robotic devices for upper limb (MIT-Manus, MIME, NeReBot, BiManu-Track, ARMin, ARMOR) and lower limb (LokoHelp, GangTrainer GT1, Haptic Walker, G-EO-Systems, Lokomat) training are here presented with the aim of highlighting the possible gains in motor function due to robotic therapy. Patients who receive robot-assisted training in combination with physiotherapy after stroke are more likely to achieve better motor function than patients trained without these devices, or only with these devices.},

With the development of exoskeleton rehabilitation robotic system, the biomechanics influence of device should be considered in rehabilitation training. This paper proposes a novel upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation device based on biomechanics, which can be used in rehabilitation of upper limb for hemi paralysis patients. This system aims at helping hemi paralysis patients recover motor function of upper limb; in addition it is suitable for variety of patients. This system is portable and wearable, which consists of exoskeleton device, hepatic device (PHANTOM Premium), motor controllers and work station (computer). This paper proposes a structural optimization scheme in order to solve some problems of bowl's structure of the rehabilitation robot. The Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire (Pro/E) software is applied to get a three-dimensional modelling, kinematics simulation and dynamic analysis of the rehabilitation robot. From the analysis, the robot end motion simulation curves were obtained to verify the optimization structure reasonable and better motion characteristics. In the future, this structure will have a wide application prospect in the rehabilitation therapy field.},

abstract = {This paper proposed a VR-based self-rehabilitation system which utilizes the virtual training model rendered by OpenGL and collects electromyography (EMG) signals from the subjects to perform hand motion recognition. EMG signals are biomedical signals generated in muscles and can be applied in many fields such as clinical diagnosis and biomedical applications. The subjects were asked to manipulate a haptic device (Phantom Premium) to operate a virtual hand to catch a ball in the virtual environment which displayed on the computer's screen. A dry electrode was attached on the subject's skin to collect sEMG signals and recognize the action of grasping. Once caught by subjects, the virtual ball will appear in another location at random on the computer's screen. Therefore, the subject needs to manipulate the Phantom to the new destination and catch the ball once again. Combining sEMG with VR Technology, the proposed self-rehabilitation system could provide enhanced visual feedback about movement trajectory, which is beneficial to improve motor function task learning and execution compared with traditional therapy. By this method, stroke patients can realize self-rehabilitation exercise of upper limb at home. The effectiveness of the proposed rehabilitation system has been verified by experiments.},

Design Single-blind, randomized trial. Setting Medical center. Participants Enrolled subjects (N=39) were {\textgreater}1 year postsingle stroke (attrition rate=10{\%}; 35 completed the study). Interventions All groups received treatment 5d/wk for 5h/d (60 sessions), with unique treatment as follows: ML alone (n=11) (5h/d partial- and whole-task practice of complex functional tasks), robotics plus ML (n=12) (3.5h/d of ML and 1.5h/d of shoulder/elbow robotics), and FES plus ML (n=12) (3.5h/d of ML and 1.5h/d of FES wrist/hand coordination training). Main Outcome Measures Primary measure: Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), with 13 complex functional tasks; secondary measure: upper-limb Fugl-Meyer coordination scale (FM). Results There was no significant difference found in treatment response across groups (AMAT: P≥.584; FM coordination: P≥.590). All 3 treatment groups demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvement in response to treatment (AMAT and FM coordination: P≤.009). A group treatment paradigm of 1:3 (therapist/patient) ratio proved feasible for provision of the intensive treatment. No adverse effects. Conclusions Severely impaired stroke survivors with persistent ({\textgreater}1y) upper-extremity dysfunction can make clinically and statistically significant gains in coordination and functional task performance in response to robotics plus ML, FES plus ML, and ML alone in an intensive and long-duration intervention; no group differences were found. Additional studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of these methods in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift.

abstract = {This article presents a novel evaluation system along with methods to evaluate bilateral coordination of arm function on activities of daily living tasks before and after robot-assisted therapy. An affordable bilateral assessment system (BiAS) consisting of two mini-passive measuring units modeled as three degree of freedom robots is described. The process for evaluating functional tasks using the BiAS is presented and we demonstrate its ability to measure wrist kinematic trajectories. Three metrics, phase difference, movement overlap, and task completion time, are used to evaluate the BiAS system on a bilateral symmetric (bi-drink) and a bilateral asymmetric (bi-pour) functional task. Wrist position and velocity trajectories are evaluated using these metrics to provide insight into temporal and spatial bilateral deficits after stroke. The BiAS system quantified movements of the wrists during functional tasks and detected differences in impaired and unimpaired arm movements. Case studies showed that stroke patients compared to healthy subjects move slower and are less likely to use their arm simultaneously even when the functional task requires simultaneous movement. After robot-assisted therapy, interlimb coordination spatial deficits moved toward normal coordination on functional tasks. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {The primary sensory and motor cortices, visual cortices, and secondary sensorimotor areas are all involved in sensory perception. The basal ganglia and thalamic-relay circuits contribute to motor planning, perception, and sensorimotor integration. The supplementary motor and premotor cortices are essential for motor preparation and execution, the latter being implemented by corticospinal fibres from the primary motor cortex under the parallel control of other descending systems. Cerebellar relays monitor motor output and execution (figure 1). The primary sensory cortex is a major source of somatosensory input to the primary motor cortex 28 because it is also the only primary sensory area that has direct connections with it. The primary motor cortex is strongly modulated by sensory flow. The existence of multiple, discrete, efferent zones in the primary motor cortex is a peculiarity of this area. In fact, selective stimulation of different regions of the primary motor cortex can produce the same movement. 29–34 The cortical areas that control digit, wrist, elbow, and shoulder movements are connected over distances of up to 10 mm by dense, bidirectional projections. Individual movements are, therefore, controlled by a network of neurons that are distributed throughout the primary motor cortex.},

@article{Jackson2007,
abstract = {Stroke is the most common cause of severe disability in the UK. Arm impairment is common and recovery is partly dependent on the intensity and frequency of rehabilitation intervention. However, physical therapy resources are often limited, so methods of supplementing traditional physiotherapy are essential. Robot assisted physiotherapy is one way to increase the duration patients spend participating in rehabilitation activities. A single robot system has been developed at the University of Leeds that actively assists patients undertaking therapeutic movements in a three-dimensional workspace. However, using only a single point of contact at the wrist to assist with therapeutic reaching movements does not allow control or support of the more proximal joints of the upper limb. This could lead to discomfort during assisted exercise. In addition, the design suffers from a restrictive workspace, limiting the range of therapeutic exercise that can be under-taken. To address these limitations, the intelligent Pneumatic Arm Movement system has been developed. A major aspect of the development process has been the continual involvement of physiotherapists and stroke patients; the end users of the system. Through inclusion of these stakeholders, a system has been developed that satisfies their requirements for workspace, comfort, safety, and ease of use. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2007.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether use of a robotic arm trainer for bilateral exercise in daily repetitive training for a 3-week period reduced spasticity and improved motor control in the arm of severely affected, chronic hemiparetic subjects. Design: Before-after trial. Setting: Community rehabilitation center in Germany. Participants: Consecutive sample of 12 chronic hemiparetic patients; minimum stroke interval 6 months; patients could maximally protract the affected shoulder, hold the extended arm, or slightly flex and extend the elbow. Interventions: Additional daily therapy of 15 minutes with the arm trainer for 3 weeks; the 1 degree of freedom trainer enabled the bilateral passive and active practice of a forearm pronation and supination and wrist dorsiflexion and volarflexion; impedance control guaranteed a smooth movement. Main Outcome Measures: Patients' impressions, the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score (range, 0-5) to assess spasticity, and the arm section of the Rivermead Motor Assessment (RMA) score (range, 0-15) to assess motor control were rated before therapy, after each 3-week interval, and at follow-up 3 months later. Results: All patients had favorable impressions: the extremity felt more vivid, and 8 subjects noticed a reduction in spasticity, an ease of hand hygiene, and pain relief. The MAS score of the wrist and fingers joints decreased significantly (P{\textless}.0125) from a median of 3 (2-3) and 3 (3-4) to 2 (1-2) and 2.5 (2-3). The RMA score minimally increased in 5 cases without improvement in functional tasks. The median RMA score before therapy was 2.0 (1-2) and 2.0 (1-3.75) after therapy. There were no side effects. At follow-up, the effects had waned. Conclusions: The arm trainer made possible intensive bilateral elbow and wrist training of severely affected stroke patients. Future studies should address the treatment effect in subacute stroke patients and determine the optimum treatment intensity. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

The strategy is implemented and evaluated on a bilateral upper limb rehabilitation device (BULReD) that is an H-bot mechanism actuated by two Maxon DC motors. The control system consists of a position controller, an admittance controller and an adaptive algorithm, where the BULReD stiffness is modified session by session based on training performance. This strategy is also integrated with subject-specific workspace for enhanced training safety. Experiments were carried out with five subjects through active reaching tasks. Results indicate that the proposed training strategy requires significant coordination of bilateral upper limbs for task completion, and is able to tune control parameters to an appropriate difficulty level based on participants' training performance. Future work will focus on its clinical evaluation on patients with upper limb disabilities.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the physiotherapeutic benefits of bilateral symmetric training (BST) for stroke survivors affected by hemiparesis. Design/methodology/approach – Other studies have investigated symmetric physiotherapy. A key difficulty in previous work is in maintaining mirror-imaged trajectories between the affected and less-affected limbs. This obstacle was overcome in this work by using a two-armed robotic exoskeleton to enforce symmetry. In total, 15 subjects, {\textgreater}6 months post stroke were, randomly assigned to bilateral symmetric robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and standard physical therapy. Findings – After 12 training sessions (90 minutes/session), the bilateral training group had the greatest intensity of movement training. They also had the greatest improvement in range of motion at the shoulder. The unilateral training group showed the greatest reduction in spasticity. Research limitations/implications – The rationale for symmetric physiotherapy is that it might promote connections from the undamaged brain hemisphere. The robot generated copious amounts of detailed kinematic data. Even though these data provided insights into the human to machine interface using different training modalities, it proved difficult to draw neurological conclusions. It is recommended that future research along these lines should include measures of neurophysiological change and/or changes in neurological activity. Practical implications – This research suggests that the advantage of bilateral symmetric movement over other modalities is slight, and that robotic training has comparable results with standard care. If BST is used, care is potentially needed to avoid exacerbation of spasticity. Finally, this research includes a novel quantitative approach for evaluating robotic training. Originality/value – This study is of value to therapeutic researchers interested in new physiotherapy techniques, roboticists interested in developing rehabilitation devices, or for rehabilitation game designers interested in using virtual reality.},

abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Background Visual field defects after posterior cerebral artery stroke can be improved by vision restoration training (VRT), but when combined with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which alters brain excitability, vision recovery can be potentiated in the chronic stage. To date, the combination of VRT and tDCS has not been evaluated in postacute stroke rehabilitation. Objectives To determine whether combined tDCS and VRT can be effectively implemented in the early recovery phase following stroke, and to explore the feasibility, safety and efficacy of an early intervention. Design Open-label pilot study including a case series of 7 tDCS/VRT versus a convenience sample of 7 control patients (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02935413). Setting Rehabilitation center. Subjects Patients with homonymous visual field defects following a posterior cerebral artery stroke. Methods Seven homonymous hemianopia patients were prospectively treated with 10 sessions of combined tDCS (2.mA, 10 daily sessions of 20 minutes) and VRT at 66 (±50) days on average poststroke. Visual field recovery was compared with the retrospective data of 7 controls, whose defect sizes and age of lesions were matched to those of the experimental subjects and who had received standard rehabilitation with compensatory eye movement and exploration training. Results All 7 patients in the treatment group completed the treatment protocol. The safety and acceptance were excellent, and patients reported occasional skin itching beneath the electrodes as the only minor side effect. Irrespective of their treatment, both groups (treatment and control) showed improved visual fields as documented by an increased mean sensitivity threshold in decibels in standard static perimetry. Recovery was significantly greater (P {\textless}.05) in the tDCS/VRT patients (36.73{\%} ± 37.0{\%}) than in the controls (10.74{\%} ± 8.86{\%}). Conclusion In this open-label pilot study, tDCS/VRT in subacute stroke was demonstrated to be safe, with excellent applicability and acceptance of the treatment. Preliminary effectiveness calculations show that tDCS/VRT may be superior to standard vision training procedures. A confirmatory, larger-sample, controlled, randomized, and double-blind trial is now underway to compare real-tDCS− versus sham-tDCS−supported visual field training in the early vision rehabilitation phase.

abstract = {A strategy for optimizing the design of a new type of wrist force sensor is presented. The design variables are the geometric sizes of the elastic sensor body, with sliding and rotating boundary conditions connected with the rigid rim. The calibration matrix, the condition number, strain-gage sensitivity, and strain gages glued to the sensor body are used to evaluate the performance of the force sensor. The finite-element method is employed here for numerical analysis of the elastic sensor body. The optimal design problem is solved by a penalty method determining the design variables. The natural frequencies and the von Mises stress are included in the constraint conditions in order to retain the force sensor within the higher natural frequency range and avoid failure, respectively. Based on the design criteria, a novel decoupled wrist force sensor is devised which, compared to existing commonly used force sensors, provides increased force sensitivity with minimum stiffness, the lowest condition number, and an excellent decoupled calibration matrix. The simple 6 x 6 calibration matrix affords genuine savings in calculation time and ensures the possibility of real-time control for a robot arm. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract = {Company disclosures greatly aid in the process of financial decision-making; therefore, they are consulted by financial investors and automated traders before exercising ownership in stocks. While humans are usually able to correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However, deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with a length of 139.1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to practitioners and executives.},

abstract = {Various instruments are used to describe poststroke functional outcome, with limited consensus as to optimal end-point for clinical trial use. Many of the popular assessment tools are administered with little formal guidance on best practice. Thus there is potential for substantial heterogeneity in functional outcome assessment poststroke, with consequent effects on trial quality. We examined functional assessment methodology in recent stroke trials. We reviewed six journals representing high-impact international publications in the fields of: stroke (Stroke); neurology (Neurology, Lancet Neurology) and internal medicine (Lancet, New England Journal Medicine; Journal of the American Medical Association). Journals were hand searched for all interventional studies in stroke patients between 2001 and 2006 inclusive. Chosen manuscripts were then analyzed for outcome assessment methodology. We identified 126 trials, comprising a mix of early hypothesis generating studies through to multi-centre trials (phase I: four trials; phase II: 46 trials; phase III: 20 trials; noninvestigational medicinal product studies: 56 trials). The median number of patients assessed per trial was 100. Across the trials, 47 different outcome measures were used. One hundred trials had functional outcome assessment as the primary study end-point. The median number of outcome measures was two per trial (range 1-9). The modified Rankin scale was the most prevalent outcome assessment (64.3{\%}); followed by Barthel index (40.5{\%}). A minority of trials (33.3{\%}) provided full details on outcome assessment methodology. Among these trials there was substantial heterogeneity in data collection procedures. There is heterogeneity in the use of functional outcome measures in stroke trials. This compromises comparison and meta-analysis. Trialists continue to use poorly validated approaches to outcome assessment. Given the potential effects on data quality, explicit description of methodology should be mandatory for all trials and rigour is desirable. {\textcopyright} 2009 World Stroke Organization.},

Design: Two-centre, observer-blinded, stratified, block-randomized controlled trial. Setting: General community. Patients: Ninety-one in dividuals within one year of a first or recurrent stroke consented to participate between May 2000 and February 2003. Interventions: The experimental intervention involved practice of functional, unilateral and bilateral tasks that were designed to improve gross and fine manual dexterity whereas the control intervention was composed of walking tasks. Members in both groups participated in three sessions a week for six weeks. Main outcome measure(s): The primary test of arm function was the Box and Block Test. Secondary tests included the Nine-Hole Peg Test, maximal grip strength, the Test d'Evaluation des Membres sup{\'{e}}rieurs des Personnes Ag{\'{e}}es (TEMPA) and the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement. Results: Results are for the more affected arm. Baseline performance on the Box and Block Test was an average of 26 blocks (standard deviation (SD) = 16) in the experimental group (n = 47) and 26 blocks (SD = 18) in the control group (n = 44). These values represent approximately 40{\%} of age-predicted values. Values for the postintervention evaluation were an average of 28 (SD = 17) and 28 (SD = 19) blocks for the experimental and control group respectively.

abstract = {Masiero S, Celia A, Rosati G, Armani M. Robotic-assisted rehabilitation of the upper limb after acute stroke. Objective: To investigate whether early therapy with a novel robotic device can reduce motor impairment and enhance functional recovery of poststroke patients with hemiparetic and hemiplegic upper limb. Design: A single-blind randomized controlled trial, with an 8-month follow-up. Setting: Neurologic department and rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Thirty-five patients with acute (≤1wk of onset), unilateral, ischemic embolic, or thrombotic stroke. Interventions: Patients of both groups received the same dose and length per day of standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The experimental group (n=17) received additional early sensorimotor robotic training, 4 hours a week for 5 weeks; the control group (n=18) was exposed to the robotic device, 30 minutes a week, twice a week, but the exercises were performed with the unimpaired upper limb. Training by robot consisted of peripheral manipulation of the shoulder and elbow of the impaired limb, correlated with visual stimuli. Main Outcome Measures: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of upper-extremity function (shoulder/elbow and coordination and wrist/hand subsections) to measure each trained limb segment; the Medical Research Council (MRC) score to measure the strength of muscle force during 3 actions: shoulder abduction (MRC deltoid), elbow flexion (MRC biceps), and wrist flexion (MRC wrist flexors); the FIM instrument and its motor component; and the Trunk Control Test (TCT) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Results: Compared with the patients in the control group, the experimental group showed significant gains in motor impairment and functional recovery of the upper limb after robot therapy, as measured by the MRC deltoid (P≤.05) and biceps (P{\textless}.05) scores, the FMA for the proximal upper arm (P{\textless}.05), the FIM instrument (P{\textless}.05), and the FIM motor score (P{\textless}.01); these gains were also sustained at the 3- and 8-month follow-up. The FMA and MRC wrist flexor test findings did not differ statistically either at the end of training or at the follow-up sessions. We found no significant differences in MAS and TCT in either group in any of the evaluations. No adverse effects occurred and the robotic approach was very well accepted. Conclusions: Patients who received robotic therapy in addition to conventional therapy showed greater reductions in motor impairment and improvements in functional abilities. Robotic therapy may therefore effectively complement standard rehabilitation from the start, by providing therapeutic support for patients with poststroke plegic and paretic upper limb. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Specially designed machines, which we call rehabilitators, could automate some of the repetitive aspects of physical and occupational therapy. Rehabilitators might also improve therapy by responding to the patient more quickly and precisely than a human therapist and by quantitatively measuring patient progress. We envision developing a family of inexpensive machines, each designed to retrain coordination in a specific activity of daily living, which could be used by physical and occupational therapists. To this end, we have built a rehabilitator for assisting hemiplegic stroke patients in bimanual lifting. In this task, subjects lift an object off a table with two hands, support it, then replace it on the table. If the disabled hand is unable to contribute to the task, the rehabilitator substitutes for it. The rehabilitator can substitute for the disabled hand well enough to lift a cafeteria tray with a cup of coffee on it without spilling it. If the disabled hand has fully recovered, the rehabilitator does not intervene. {\textcopyright} 1995, IEEE},

abstract = {This study proposed to design a robotic hand exoskeleton for rehabilitation in post-stroke individuals controlled by surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals. A control system consisting of threshold detection, classification module and actuator control was designed. Six representative functional hand gestures was recognized using support vector machine (SVM) based on the sEMG signals captured from eight forearm and hand muscles. Kinematic simulation was performed, by which the maximum joint angles for extension was measured. Results showed that the angle changes in metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of index, middle, ring and pinky were more than 7°. The angle changes of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints of the four fingers exceeded 77° and 43°, respectively. The accuracy of gesture classification was higher than 95.5{\%}, which was superior to the results of previous studies. This device provided an innovative prototype and would play a role in hand rehabilitation in post-stroke individuals.},

abstract = {Background: Physical rehabilitation is an area where robotics could contribute significantly to improved motor return for individuals following a stroke. This paper presents the results of a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a robot system used in the rehabilitation of the paretic arm following a stroke. Methods. The study's objectives were to explore the efficacy of this new type of robotic therapy as compared to standard physiotherapy treatment in treating the post-stroke arm; to evaluate client satisfaction with the proposed robotic system; and to provide data for sample size calculations for a proposed larger multicenter RCT. Twenty clients admitted to an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit were randomly allocated to one of two groups, an experimental (robotic arm therapy) group or a control group (conventional therapy). An occupational therapist blinded to patient allocation administered two reliable measures, the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI-7) and the Chedoke McMaster Stroke Assessment of the Arm and Hand (CMSA) at admission and discharge. For both groups, at admission, the CMSA motor impairment stage of the affected arm was between 1 and 3. Results: Data were compared to determine the effectiveness of robot-assisted versus conventional therapy treatments. At the functional level, both groups performed well, with improvement in scores on the CAHAI-7 showing clinical and statistical significance. The CAHAI-7 (range7-49) is a measure of motor performance using functional items. Individuals in the robotic therapy group, on average, improved by 62{\%} (95{\%} CI: 26{\%} to 107{\%}) while those in the conventional therapy group changed by 30{\%} (95{\%} CI: 4{\%} to 61{\%}). Although performance on this measure is influenced by hand recovery, our results showed that both groups had similar stages of motor impairment in the hand. Furthermore, the degree of shoulder pain, as measured by the CMSA pain inventory scale, did not worsen for either group over the course of treatment. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that robotic arm therapy alone, without additional physical therapy interventions tailored to the paretic arm, was as effective as standard physiotherapy treatment for all responses and more effective than conventional treatment for the CMSA Arm (p = 0.04) and Hand (p = 0.04). At the functional level, both groups performed equally well. {\textcopyright} 2011 Abdullah et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The primary focus of rehabilitation for individuals with loss of upper limb movement as a result of acquired brain injury is the relearning of specific motor skills and daily tasks. This relearning is essential because the loss of upper limb movement often results in a reduced quality of life. Although rehabilitation strives to take advantage of neuroplastic processes during recovery, results of traditional approaches to upper limb rehabilitation have not entirely met this goal. In contrast, enriched training tasks, simulated with a wide range of low-to high-end virtual reality-based simulations, can be used to provide meaningful, repetitive practice together with salient feedback, thereby maximizing neuroplastic processes via motor learning and motor recovery. Such enriched virtual environments have the potential to optimize motor learning by manipulating practice conditions that explicitly engage motivational, cognitive, motor control, and sensory feedback-based learning mechanisms. The objectives of this article are to review motor control and motor learning principles, to discuss how they can be exploited by virtual reality training environments, and to provide evidence concerning current applications for upper limb motor recovery. The limitations of the current technologies with respect to their effectiveness and transfer of learning to daily life tasks also are discussed.},

It has been proved that bilateral arm e.rercise can stimulate ipsilateral corticospinal pathways and enhance recovery; also the coordination of the two limbs can reduce hypertonia and abnormal synergies compared to unilateral limb training. In conventional bilateral arm training robots the healthy limb provides a reference movement and the robot gi?es an assistant forie for the impaired limb to implement mirror image mno?emnents or the healthy limb assists the impaired limb to accomplish the desired mnovemnent whereas no resistant force was supplied for patients with the healthy limb to per form strength enhancemnent training. This paper introduces a novel master- slave rehabilitation robot to implement bilateral arm coordinated training. The robot supports passive active-assisted and active-constrained training modes. No matter in which mnode the corresponding force provided for the impaired limb is from the healthy limb. A prototype was developed with two identical motors. A subject controls the two motors with his/her two limbs to accornplish desired movements. Preliminary tests were conducted, the results confirm the validity of the system in different training modes, and verify the system's force sensing capability enerqy recyclinq function and bidirectional controllability.

abstract = {Early diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases is crucial for their treatment, but even experienced physicians find it difficult, as their clinical manifestations are similar. In order to assist with the diagnosis, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed. These commonly rely on a fixed scale classifier that scans CT images, recognizes textural lung patterns, and generates a map of pathologies. In a previous study, we proposed a method for classifying lung tissue patterns using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), with an architecture designed for the specific problem. In this study, we present an improved method for training the proposed network by transferring knowledge from the similar domain of general texture classification. Six publicly available texture databases are used to pretrain networks with the proposed architecture, which are then fine-tuned on the lung tissue data. The resulting CNNs are combined in an ensemble and their fused knowledge is compressed back to a network with the original architecture. The proposed approach resulted in an absolute increase of about 2{\%} in the performance of the proposed CNN. The results demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in the field of medical image analysis, indicate the textural nature of the problem and show that the method used for training a network can be as important as designing its architecture.},

abstract = {Purpose. To investigate the effect of bilateral reaching, with/without inertial loading on the unaffected arm, on hemiparetic arm motor control in stroke. Methods. Twenty unilateral stroke patients were recruited. A three-dimensional optical motion capture system was used to measure the movement trajectory of the hemiparetic arm while performing three tasks: affected limb reaching forward; two-limb reaching forward; and two-limb reaching forward with inertia loading of 25{\%} upper limb weight on the unaffected limb, respectively. Kinematical parameters were utilized to quantify the reaching performance of the affected arm. Results. No matter whether loading was applied on the unaffected arm or not, the bilateral reaching task did not significantly facilitate smoother and faster movement. Furthermore, during bilateral reaching task with/without loading on the unaffected arm, stroke patients showed slower movement, lower maximal movement velocity, feedback control dominant and discontinuous movements in the affected arm than the same task with unilateral reaching. Subjects showed the greatest active upper extremity range of motion in proximal joints during the bilateral reaching task without unaffected arm loading. The amount of trunk movement also increased during bilateral reaching either with or without loading on the unaffected arm. Patients with moderate upper extremity motor impairment performed more discontinuous movements and less active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks; however, those with mild upper extremity motor impairment performed smoother movements and demonstrated greater active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks. Conclusions. Bilateral reaching tasks with/without loading on the unaffected arm could be considered as adding challenges during motor control training. Training with bilateral arm movements may be considered as a treatment strategy, and can be incorporated in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate greater arm active movement and improve motor control performance in the affected arm.},

In line with a distal bilateral approach, the equipment comprised 4 workstations, 1 finger trainer, and 3 machines for bilateral training of selected distal and proximal movements. Design: Open study. Subjects: Of 119 treated patients after subacute stroke, 30 completed a questionnaire and 24 were assessed. Methods: All patients completed 15 sessions, each of 30-45 min duration, on each of 2 workstations. Based on the patients' impairment level they were divided into 3 groups, as follows: group A, plegic; group B, proximal and distal movements but hand non-functional; and group C, able to grasp and release an object. Motor functions were assessed with the Fugl-Meyer Score (FM, 0-66) for groups A (n=6) and B (n=6), and the Action Arm Research Test (ARAT, 0-57) for group C (n=12). Results: No side-effects occurred.

We prove that the discrepancy is a distance for the squared loss when the hypothesis set is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by a universal kernel such as the Gaussian kernel. We give new pointwise loss guarantees based on the discrepancy of the empirical source and target distributions for the general class of kernel-based regularization algorithms. These bounds have a simpler form than previous results and hold for a broader class of convex loss functions not necessarily differentiable, including L q losses and the hinge loss. We extend the discrepancy minimization adaptation algorithm to the more significant case where kernels are used and show that the problem can be cast as an SDP similar to the one in the feature space. We also show that techniques from smooth optimization can be used to derive an efficient algorithm for solving such SDPs even for very high-dimensional feature spaces. We have implemented this algorithm and report the results of experiments demonstrating its benefits for adaptation and show that, unlike previous algorithms, it can scale to large data sets of tens of thousands or more points. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In recent years, new rehabilitation techniques have emerged such as constraint-induced therapy, biofeedback therapy and robot-aided therapy. In particular, robotic techniques allow precise recording of movements and application of forces to the affected limb, making it a valuable tool for motor rehabilitation. In addition, robotaided therapy can utilise visual cues conveyed on a computer screen to convert repetitive movement practice into an engaging task such as a game. Visual cues can also be used to control the information sent to the patient about exercise performance and to potentially address psychosomatic variables influencing therapy. This paper overviews the current state-of-the-art on upper limb robotmediated therapy with a focal point on the technical requirements of robotic therapy devices leading to the development of upper limb rehabilitation techniques that facilitate reach-to-touch, fine motor control, whole-arm movements and promote rehabilitation beyond hospital stay. The reviewed literature suggest that while there is evidence supporting the use of this technology to reduce functional impairment, besides the technological push, the challenge ahead lies on provision of effective assessment of outcome and modalities that have a stronger impact transferring functional gains into functional independence. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology has the potential to restore motor function by inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an EEG-based MI BCI system coupled with MIT-Manus shoulder-elbow robotic feedback (BCI-Manus) for subjects with chronic stroke with upper-limb hemiparesis. In this single-blind, randomized trial, 26 hemiplegic subjects (Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery After Stroke [FMMA] score, 4-40; 16 men; mean age, 51.4 years; mean stroke duration, 297.4 days), prescreened with the ability to use the MI BCI, were randomly allocated to BCI-Manus or Manus therapy, lasting 18 hours over 4 weeks. Efficacy was measured using upper-extremity FMMA scores at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 12. ElEG data from subjects allocated to BCI-Manus were quantified using the revised brain symmetry index (rBSI) and analyzed for correlation with the improvements in FMMA score. Eleven and 15 subjects underwent BCI-Manus and Manus therapy, respectively. One subject in the Manus group dropped out. Mean total FMMA scores at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 12 weeks improved for both groups: 26.3 ± 10.3, 27.4 ± 12.0, 30.8 ± 13.8, and 31.5 ± 13.5 for BCI-Manus and 26.6 ± 18.9, 29.9 ± 20.6, 32.9 ± 21.4, and 33.9 ± 20.2 for Manus, with no intergroup differences (P =.51). More subjects attained further gains in FMMA scores at week 12 from BCI-Manus (7 of 11 [63.6{\%}]) than Manus (5 of 14 [35.7{\%}]). A negative correlation was found between the rBSI and FMMA score improvement (P =.044). BCI-Manus therapy was well tolerated and not associated with adverse events. In conclusion, BCI-Manus therapy is effective and safe for arm rehabilitation after severe poststroke hemiparesis. Motor gains were comparable to those attained with intensive robotic therapy (1,040 repetitions/session) despite reduced arm exercise repetitions using EEG-based MI-triggered robotic feedback (136 repetitions/session). The correlation of rBSI with motor improvements suggests that the rBSI can be used as a prognostic measure for BCI-based stroke rehabilitation.},

abstract = {The ArmAssist is a simple low-cost robotic system for upper limb motor training that combines known benefits of repetitive task-oriented training, greater intensity of practice, and less dependence on therapist assistance. The aim of this preliminary study was to compare the efficacy of ArmAssist (AA) robotic training against matched conventional arm training in subacute stroke subjects with moderate-to-severe upper limb impairment. Twenty-six subjects were enrolled within 3 months of stroke and randomly assigned to the AA group or Control group (n=13 each). Both groups were trained 5 days per week for 3 weeks. The primary outcome measure was Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) motor score, and the secondary outcomes were Wolf Motor Function Test-Functional Ability Scale (WMFT-FAS) and Barthel index (BI). The AA group, in comparison to the Control group, showed significantly greater increases in FMA-UE score (18.0 ± 9.4 versus 7.5 ± 5.5, p=0.002) and WMFT-FAS score (14.1 ± 7.9 versus 6.7 ± 7.8, p=0.025) after 3 weeks of treatment, whereas the increase in BI was not significant (21.2 ± 24.8 versus 13.1 ± 10.7, p=0.292). There were no adverse events. We conclude that arm training using the AA robotic device is safe and able to reduce motor deficits more effectively than matched conventional arm training in subacute phase of stroke.

abstract = {Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4{\%} of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6{\%} parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100{\%} of the parameters per task.},

It has been designed by having in mind the range of forces and the frequency bandwidth that characterize the interaction between a patient and a physical therapist, as well as a number of requirements that we think are essential for allowing a natural haptic interaction: back-driveability, very low friction and inertia, mechanical robustness, the possibility to operate in different planes, and an open software environment, which allows the operator to add new functionalities and design personalized rehabilitation protocols. Braccio di Ferro is an open system and, in the spirit of open source design, is intended to foster the dissemination of robot therapy.

abstract = {Objective: To carry out a preliminary feasibility study of a new concept of robot therapy for severely impaired patients after stroke. Design: A haptic manipulandum connected to a bar that can rotate freely while providing a measure of the rotation angle. The controller combines a bilateral reaching task with the task of balancing the action of the 2 arms. Reinforcement is given to the subject in 2 forms: audio-visual and haptic by means of adaptable force fields. Patients: Four highly paretic patients with chronic stroke (Fugl-Meyer score less than 15). Methods: The training cycle consisted of 5 sessions over a period of 2 weeks. Each session (45 min) was divided in blocks of 10 pairs of forward/backward movements. Performance was determined by evaluating the number of successful movements per session, the session-by-session decrease in the assistive field, the mean reaching time, and the mean stopping field. Results: All subjects could understand the task, appreciated it and improved their performance during training. The reaching movements became smoother and quicker; balance errors and the magnitude of the resisting field were consistently reduced. Conclusion: Bilateral robot therapy is a promising technique, provided that it self-adapts to the patient's performance. Formal clinical trials should address this point. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Background: About 80{\%} of all stroke survivors have an upper limb paresis immediately after stroke, only about a third of whom (30 to 40{\%}) regain some dexterity within six months following conventional treatment programs. Of late, however, two recently developed interventions - constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) - have shown promising results in the treatment of upper limb paresis in chronic stroke patients. The ULTRA-stroke (acronym for Upper Limb TRaining After stroke) program was conceived to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in subacute stroke patients and to examine how the observed changes in sensori-motor functioning relate to changes in stroke recovery mechanisms associated with peripheral stiffness, interlimb interactions, and cortical inter- and intrahemispheric networks. The present paper describes the design of this single-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT), which has recently started and will take several years to complete. Methods/Design: Sixty patients with a first ever stroke will be recruited. Patients will be stratified in terms of their remaining motor ability at the distal part of the arm (i.e., wrist and finger movements) and randomized over three intervention groups receiving modified CIMT, modified BATRAC, or an equally intensive (i.e., dose-matched) conventional treatment program for 6 weeks. Primary outcome variable is the score on the Action Research Arm test (ARAT), which will be assessed before, directly after, and 6 weeks after the intervention. During those test sessions all patients will also undergo measurements aimed at investigating the associated recovery mechanisms using haptic robots and magneto-encephalography (MEG). Discussion: ULTRA-stroke is a 3-year translational research program which aims (1) to assess the relative effectiveness of the three interventions, on a group level but also as a function of patient characteristics, and (2) to delineate the functional and neurophysiological changes that are induced by those interventions. Trial Registration: The outcome on the ARAT together with information about changes in the associated mechanisms will provide a better understanding of how specific therapies influence neurobiological changes, and which post-stroke conditions lend themselves to specific treatments. {\textcopyright} 2009 van Delden et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel electromyography (EMG)-driven hand exoskeleton for bilateral rehabilitation of grasping in stroke. The developed hand exoskeleton was designed with two distinctive features: (a) kinematics with intrinsic adaptability to patient's hand size, and (b) free-palm and free-fingertip design, preserving the residual sensory perceptual capability of touch during assistance in grasping of real objects. In the envisaged bilateral training strategy, the patient's non paretic hand acted as guidance for the paretic hand in grasping tasks. Grasping force exerted by the non paretic hand was estimated in real-time from EMG signals, and then replicated as robotic assistance for the paretic hand by means of the hand-exoskeleton. Estimation of the grasping force through EMG allowed to perform rehabilitation exercises with any, non sensorized, graspable objects. This paper presents the system design, development, and experimental evaluation. Experiments were performed within a group of six healthy subjects and two chronic stroke patients, executing robotic-assisted grasping tasks. Results related to performance in estimation and modulation of the robotic assistance, and to the outcomes of the pilot rehabilitation sessions with stroke patients, positively support validity of the proposed approach for application in stroke rehabilitation.},

Twenty-six stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis were randomly assigned to the stimulation duration groups, and subjects completed 4 days of rehabilitation training over a 2-week period. Mixed design analyses of variance on the Box and Block scores, chronometric reaction times, and force modulation of the sustained muscle contraction task revealed distinct motor recovery improvements for both the 5 and 10 s stimulation duration groups in comparison to the 0 s duration control group. Further, the number of blocks moved by the 10-s duration group exceeded those moved by the 5-s duration group.

abstract = {A six degree-of-freedom thrust sensor was designed, constructed, calibrated, and tested using the lab-scale hybrid rocket at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR). The system consisted of six independent legs: one parallel to the axis of symmetry of the rocket for main thrust measurement, two vertical legs near the nozzle end of the rocket, one vertical leg near the oxygen input end of the rocket, and two separated horizontal legs near the nozzle end. Each leg was composed of a rotational bearing, a load cell, and a universal joint above and below the load cell. The leg was designed to create point contact along only one direction and minimize the non-axial forces applied to the load cell. With this system, force in each direction and moments for roll, pitch, and yaw can be measured. Each load cell was individually calibrated using a dead-weight test bed. The six-load-cell system was calibrated with the rocket in place by applying known forces in each direction and mechanically applied roll, pitch, and yaw motions. Calibration curves show linear load cell reaction in the direction of applied force and isolation in all other directions. The system was tested using a lab-scale hybrid rocket using gaseous oxygen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) solid fuel. The thrust stand proved to be stable during initial firing tests. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Force Sensitive Resistors (FSRs) are commercially available thin film polymer sensors commonly employed in a multitude of biomechanical measurement environments. Reasons for such wide spread usage lie in the versatility, small profile, and low cost of these sensors. Yet FSRs have limitations. It is commonly accepted that temperature, curvature and biological tissue compliance may impact sensor conductance and resulting force readings. The effect of these variables and degree to which they interact has yet to be comprehensively investigated and quantified. This work systematically assesses varying levels of temperature, sensor curvature and surface compliance using a full factorial design-of-experiments approach. Three models of Interlink FSRs were evaluated. Calibration equations under 12 unique combinations of temperature, curvature and compliance were determined for each sensor. Root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and maximum error were quantified as measures of the impact these thermo/mechanical factors have on sensor performance. It was found that all three variables have the potential to affect FSR calibration curves. The FSR model and corresponding sensor geometry are sensitive to these three mechanical factors at varying levels. Experimental results suggest that reducing sensor error requires calibration of each sensor in an environment as close to its intended use as possible and if multiple FSRs are used in a system, they must be calibrated independently.},

abstract = {Knowing accurate model of a system is always beneficial to design a robust and safe control while allowing reduction of sensors-related cost as the system outputs are predictable using the model. In this context, this paper addresses the kinematical and dynamical model identification of the multipurpose rehabilitation robot, Universal Haptic Pantograph (UHP), and present experimental validations of the identified models. The UHP is a Pantograph based innovative robot actuated by two SEAs (Series Elastic Actuator), aiming at training impaired upper limbs after a stroke. This novel robot, thanks to its lockable/unlockable joints, can change its mechanical structure so that it enables stroke patient to perform different training exercises of the shoulder, elbow and wrist. This work focuses on the ARM mode, which is a training mode used to rehabilitate elbow and shoulder. The kinematical model of UHP is identified based on the loop vector equations, while the dynamical model is derived based on the Lagrangian formulation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the models, several experimental tests were performed. The results reveal that the mean position error between estimated values with the model and actual measured values stays in 3 mm (less than 2{\%} of the maximum motion range). Moreover, the error between estimated and measured interaction force is smaller than 10{\%} of maximum force range. So, the developed models can be adopted to estimate motion and force of UHP as well as control it without the need of additional sensors such as a force sensor, resulting in the reduction of total robot cost.},

abstract = {Robotic motor rehabilitation is a promising approach to rehabilitation of post stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury neuromotor impairments. We have observed that manual physiotherapy of spastic hemiparetic patients include 45 different types of three-dimensional repetitive shoulder-elbow motion exercises. The physical capabilities as well as the availability of the physiotherapist limit the realization of effective physiotherapy in daily routine. The paper describes the REHAROB Therapeutic System that uses two industrial robot arms for exercising the patient's upper limb. Special devices and measures make the system safe both for the patient and for the physiotherapist. The current REHAROB system performs individual, three-dimensional, anti-spastic passive motion therapy in the full range of concerted shoulder girdle (5) and elbow (2) motions but due to its versatility it is going to be expanded towards active assisted and active against resistance therapy, and for the physiotherapy of spastic hemiparetic lower limbs. The REHAROB Therapeutic System was designed to integrate commercially available robot, safety, control, and sensor components.},

abstract = {Background: The current treatment intervention study determined the effect of coupled bilateral training (i.e., bilateral movements and EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation) and resistive load (mass) on upper extremity motor recovery in chronic stroke. Methods: Thirty chronic stroke subjects were randomly assigned to one of three behavioral treatment groups and completed 6 hours of rehabilitation in 4 days: (1) coupled bilateral training with a load on the unimpaired hand, (2) coupled bilateral training with no load on the unimpaired hand, and (3) control (no stimulation assistance or load). Results: Separate mixed design ANOVAs revealed improved motor capabilities by the coupled bilateral groups. From the pretest to the posttest, both the coupled bilateral no load and load groups moved a higher number of blocks and demonstrated more regularity in the sustained contraction task. Faster motor reaction times across test sessions for the coupled bilateral load group provided additional evidence for improved motor capabilities. Conclusions: Together these behavioral findings lend support to the contribution of coupled bilateral training with a load on the unimpaired arm to improved motor capabilities on the impaired arm. This evidence supports a neural explanation in that simultaneously moving both limbs during stroke rehabilitation training appears to activate balanced interhemispheric interactions while an extra load on the unimpaired limb provides stability to the system. {\textcopyright} 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

Although various approaches have been proposed to facilitate synchronized robot-assisted bilateral movements, few studies have focused on addressing the varying joint stiffness resulting from dynamic motions. This paper presents a novel bilateral rehabilitation system that implements a surface electromyography (sEMG)-based stiffness control to achieve real-time stiffness adjustment based on the user's dynamic motion. An sEMG-driven musculoskeletal model that incorporates muscle activation and muscular contraction dynamics is developed to provide reference signals for the robot's real-time stiffness control. Preliminary experiments were conducted to evaluate the system performance in tracking accuracy and comfortability, which showed the proposed rehabilitation system with sEMG-based real-time stiffness variation achieved fast adaption to the patient's dynamic movement as well as improving the comfort in robot-assisted bilateral training.},

abstract = {Cerebral palsy is a childhood-onset, lifelong neurological disorder that primarily impairs motor function. Unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), which impairs use of one hand and perturbs bimanual co-ordination, is the most common form of the condition. The main contemporary upper limb rehabilitation strategies for UCP are constraint-induced movement therapy and bimanual intensive therapy. In this Review, we outline the factors that are crucial to the success of motor rehabilitation in children with UCP, including the dose of training, the relevance of training to daily life, the suitability of training to the age and goals of the child, and the ability of the child to maintain close attention to the tasks. Emerging evidence suggests that the first 2 years of life are a critical period during which interventions for UCP could be more effective than in later life. Abnormal brain organization in UCP, and the effects of development on rehabilitation, must also be understood to develop new effective interventions. Therefore, we also consider neuroimaging methods that can provide insight into the neurobiology of UCP and how the condition responds to existing therapies. We discuss how these methods could shape future rehabilitative strategies based on the neurobiology of UCP and the therapy-induced changes seen in the brain.},

abstract = {Transfer learning addresses the problem of how to utilize plenty of labeled data in a source domain to solve related but different problems in a target domain, even when the training and testing problems have different distributions or features. In this paper, we consider transfer learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions between the source domain data and the target domain data are the same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classification or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to find a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is verified by experiments in two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary text classification.

abstract = {Objective: Individuals with neurological damage (e.g., stroke or cerebral palsy) often experience a significant loss of arm function. Robotic devices that address muscle strength deficits in a task-specific manner can assist in the recovery of arm function; however, current devices are typically large, bulky, and expensive to be routinely used in the clinic or at home. This study sought to address this issue by developing a portable planar passive rehabilitation robot, PaRRo. Methods: We designed PaRRo with a mechanical layout that incorporated kinematic redundancies to generate forces that directly oppose the user's movement. Cost-efficient eddy current brakes were used to provide scalable resistances. The lengths of the robots linkages were optimized to have a reasonably large workspace for human planar reaching. We then performed theoretical analysis of the robot's resistive force generating capacity and steerable workspace using MATLAB simulations. We also validated a prototype device by having a subject move the end-effector along different paths at a set velocity using a metronome while simultaneously collecting surface electromyography (EMG) and end-effector forces felt by the user. Results: Results from simulation experiments indicated that the robot was capable of producing sufficient end-effector forces for functional resistance training. We also found the end-effector forces from the user were similar to the theoretical forces expected at any direction of motion. EMG results indicated that the device was capable of providing adjustable resistances based on subjects' ability levels, as the muscle activation levels scaled with increasing magnet exposures. Conclusion: These results indicate that PaRRo is a feasible approach to provide functional resistance training to the muscles along the upper-extremity. Significance: The proposed robotic device could provide a technological breakthrough that will make rehabilitation robots accessible for small outpatient rehabilitation centers and in-home therapy.},

Three adults with CP and five healthy adults performed three types of bilateral and unilateral ADLs: drink, pour, and pick and place tasks. An affordable bilateral assessment system (BiAS) was used to measure wrist kinematic trajectories. Four metrics, total completion time, maximum velocity, smoothness, and phase difference, were used to evaluate each functional task. Overall, adults with CP took a longer time than the healthy subjects to complete all unilateral functional tasks with their non-dominant hand. Moreover, while the healthy controls had similar mean velocities in the dominant and non-dominant hands during the bilateral tasks, adults with CP typically exhibited slower mean velocities in the dominant hand during the bilateral tasks than during the unilateral dominant tasks. Similar to existing literature, we found that adults with CP compensated by slowing the dominant arm to match the non-dominant arm in order to complete the tasks, showing the importance of utilizing bilateral training in upper limb rehabilitation treatments.},

In this context, this paper addresses the kinematical and dynamical model identification of the multipurpose rehabilitation robot, Universal Haptic Pantograph (UHP), and present experimental validations of the identified models. The UHP is a Pantograph based innovative robot actuated by two SEAs (Series Elastic Actuator), aiming at training impaired upper limbs after a stroke. This novel robot, thanks to its lockable/unlockable joints, can change its mechanical structure so that it enables stroke patient to perform different training exercises of the shoulder, elbow and wrist. This work focuses on the ARM mode, which is a training mode used to rehabilitate elbow and shoulder. The kinematical model of UHP is identified based on the loop vector equations, while the dynamical model is derived based on the Lagrangian formulation. To demonstrate the accuracy of the models, several experimental tests were performed. The results reveal that the mean position error between estimated values with the model and actual measured values stays in 3 mm (less than 2{\%} of the maximum motion range). Moreover, the error between estimated and measured interaction force is smaller than 10{\%} of maximum force range. So, the developed models can be adopted to estimate motion and force of UHP as well as control it without the need of additional sensors such as a force sensor, resulting in the reduction of total robot cost.},

abstract = {The use of robotic devices to provide active motor support and sensory feedback of ongoing motor intention, by means of a Brain Computer Interface (BCI), has received growing support by recent literature, with particular focus on neurorehabilitation therapies. At the same time, performance in the use of the BCI has become a more critical factor, since it directly influences congruency and consistency of the provided sensory feedback. As motor imagery is the mental simulation of a given movement without depending on residual function, training of patients in the use of motor imagery BCI can be extended beyond each rehabilitation session, and practiced by using simpler devices than rehabilitation robots available in the hospital. In this work, we investigated the use of haptic stimulation provided by vibrating electromagnetic motors to enhance BCI system training. The BCI is based on motor imagery of hand grasping and designed to operate a hand exoskeleton. We investigated whether haptic stimulation at fingerpads proves to be more effective than stimulation at wrist, already experimented in literature, due to the higher density of mechano-receptors. Our results did not show significant differences between the two body locations in BCI performance, yet a wider and more stable event-relateddesynchronization appeared for the finger-located stimulation. Future investigations will put in relation training with haptic feedback at fingerpads with BCI performance using the handexoskeleton, in grasping tasks that naturally involve haptic feedback at fingerpads.},

abstract = {Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) often show upper limb impairments which impact their ability to execute activities of daily living (ADLs). Three adults with CP and five healthy adults performed three types of bilateral and unilateral ADLs: drink, pour, and pick and place tasks. An affordable bilateral assessment system (BiAS) was used to measure wrist kinematic trajectories. Four metrics, total completion time, maximum velocity, smoothness, and phase difference, were used to evaluate each functional task. Overall, adults with CP took a longer time than the healthy subjects to complete all unilateral functional tasks with their non-dominant hand. Moreover, while the healthy controls had similar mean velocities in the dominant and non-dominant hands during the bilateral tasks, adults with CP typically exhibited slower mean velocities in the dominant hand during the bilateral tasks than during the unilateral dominant tasks. Similar to existing literature, we found that adults with CP compensated by slowing the dominant arm to match the non-dominant arm in order to complete the tasks, showing the importance of utilizing bilateral training in upper limb rehabilitation treatments.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) in regression under the assumption of linear hypotheses (e.g. Beer–Lambert's law) – a task recurrently encountered in analytical chemistry. Following the ideas from the non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) method, we propose a novel algorithm that identifies a low-dimensional subspace aiming at the following two objectives: (i) the projections of the source domain samples are informative w.r.t. the output variable and (ii) the projected domain-specific input samples have a small covariance difference. In particular, the latent variable vectors that span this subspace are derived in closed-form by solving a constrained optimization problem for each subspace dimension adding flexibility for balancing the two objectives. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art (SoA) methods on different DA scenarios involving unsupervised adaptation of multivariate calibration models between different process lines in Melamine production and equality to SoA on two well-known benchmark datasets from analytical chemistry involving (unsupervised) model adaptation between different spectrometers.

abstract = {The rehabilitation exoskeleton robot is more and more used in the assisting stroke patients in implementing rehabilitation training. In this paper, a novel exoskeleton hand robot which was driven by cable has been proposed to aim at helping varieties of paralyses patients recover motor function. This exoskeleton hand rehabilitation robot system mainly consists of exoskeleton hand robot, EEG system, motor controllers unit, some sensors and a workstation. And the hand exoskeleton mechanism was portable, wearable and adjustable for patients doing home rehabilitation training. Based on the parameters from human hand, the kinematic model of hand robot was established to be used in designing and the kinematic simulation experiments about this exoskeleton hand robot were done. Through the simulation software ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems), the parameters of position, angle velocity and angle accelerated velocity (PVA) of proximate inter-phalanger (DIP) distal inter-phalanger joint were simulated. And then, the movement situation of the DIP joint was obtained according to the data from the position encoder. So the velocity curve and accelerated velocity curve were obtained by calculating the actual position function derivation. The simulated results showed that this exoskeleton hand robot has high movement ability to finish the continuous passive motion (CPM). Beside that, a comparison test was done to verify whether there were some motion blocks in wearing exoskeleton robot. Through analyzing the experimental data, the error between the actual position and the simulated position of the PIP joint of the finger was very small which verified the small interference of robot. These experiments demonstrated that the exoskeleton hand robot has high efficiency movement ability for stroke patients who need to do the finger rehabilitation training. In the future, the optimization design of the exoskeleton hand robot will be done in order to improve more movement ability.},

abstract = {Objective: Recovery of movement in the densely hemiplegic upper extremity re mains a problem after stroke. This study aimed to determine whether movement recovery could be improved in the hemiplegic arm with bilateral isokinematic training. Methods: Within and between groups, planned comparisons investigated the effects of bilateral training on attempts at two movements by subjects with acute and chronic problems with one and two bilateral practice phases. Electromyographic (EMG) activity of mid dle deltoid and extensor carpi radialis longus in the hemiplegic arm was recorded dur ing unilateral and bilateral isometric shoulder abduction and wrist extension. Results: Small increases in muscle activity were demonstrated by both experimental and con trol subjects during most bilateral practices in both actions. However, these increases were not significantly different from the previous unilateral trial, and the bilateral ef fect failed to generalize to subsequent trials. Previous studies with less densely hemiplegic subjects had demonstrated generalization of improvements in movement patterns with bilateral training to unimanual actions of the densely hemiplegic arm. Conclusions: Extensive lesions may limit brain reorganization and recover of dense hemiplegia after stroke. Nonetheless, on the basis of findings from other studies in which functional im provements occurred in both acute and chronic severely stroke-affected subjects, out come forecasting for the hemiplegic upper extremity should only eventuate after provi sion of practice under optimal learning conditions. {\textcopyright} 2001, Sage Publications.

abstract = {Background and Purpose - To compare a computerized arm trainer (AT), allowing repetitive practice of passive and active bilateral forearm and wrist movement cycle, and electromyography-initiated electrical stimulation (ES) of the paretic wrist extensor in severely affected subacute stroke patients. Method - A total of 44 patients, 4 to 8 weeks after stroke causing severe arm paresis (Fugl-Meyer Motor Score [FM, O to 66] {\textless}18), were randomly assigned to either AT or ES. All patients practiced 20 minutes every workday for 6 weeks. AT patients performed 800 repetitions per session with the robot and ES patients performed 60 to 80 wrist extensions per session. The primary outcome measure was the blindly assessed FM (0 to 66), and the secondary measures were the upper limb muscle power (Medical Research Council [MRC] sum, 0 to 45) and muscle tone (Ashworth score sum, 0 to 25), assessed at the beginning and end of treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Results - The AT group had a higher Barthel Index score at baseline, but the groups were otherwise homogenous. As expected, FM and MRC sum scores improved overtime in both groups but significantly more in the robot AT group. The initial Barthel Index score had no influence. In the robot AT group, FM score was 15 points higher at study end and 13 points higher at 3-month follow-up than the control ES group. MRC sum score was 15 points higher at study end and at 3-month follow-up compared with the control ES group. Muscle tone remained unchanged, and no side effects occurred. Conclusion - The computerized active arm training produced a superior improvement in upper limb motor control and power compared with ES in severely affected stroke patients. This is probably attributable to the greater number of repetitions and the bilateral approach. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Responsiveness of clinical assessments is an important element in the report of clinical effectiveness after rehabilitation. The correlation could reflect the validity of assessments as an indication of clinical performance before and after interventions. This study investigated the correlation and responsiveness of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Motor Status Scale (MSS), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), which are used frequently in effectiveness studies of robotic upper-extremity training in stroke rehabilitation. Twenty-seven chronic stroke patients were recruited for a 20-session upper-extremity rehabilitation robotic training program. This was a rater-blinded randomized controlled trial. All participants were evaluated with FMA, MSS, ARAT, MAS, and Functional Independent Measure before and after robotic training. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was applied for the analysis of correlation. The standardized response mean (SRM) and Guyatt's responsiveness index (GRI) were used to analyze responsiveness. Spearman's correlation coefficient showed a significantly high correlation ($\rho$=0.91-0.96) among FMA, MSS, and ARAT and a fair-to-moderate correlation ($\rho$=0.40-0.62) between MAS and the other assessments. FMA, MSS, and MAS on the wrist showed higher responsiveness (SRM=0.85-0.98, GRI=1.59-3.62), whereas ARAT showed relatively less responsiveness (SRM=0.22, GRI=0.81). The results showed that FMA or MSS would be the best choice for evaluating the functional improvement in stroke studies on robotic upper-extremity training with high responsiveness and good correlation with ARAT. MAS could be used separately to evaluate the spasticity changes after intervention in terms of high responsiveness. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Clinical observation of bilateral action and the motor control literature suggested a novel method of normalizing patterns of upper extremity movement following stroke, a problem that continues to challenge rehabilitation research. Eight single case, multiple baseline experiments on post-acute stroke subjects compared bilateral isokinematic training (BIT) against unilateral practice with the hemiplegic upper extremity (four experiments) or against bilateral practice with hands linked (four experiments). Unilateral performance with the hemiplegic arm of three grasp and reach actions (block placement, simulated drinking, peg to eye level target) was measured by blind, standardized observational kinematic analysis over four phases of ten daily sessions. For all three actions, phase 1 comprised baseline conditions of either unilateral practice or bilateral practice with linked hands. Baselines continued until introduction of BIT in staggered order to each of the three actions in phases 2, 3, or 4. Improvements were statistically superior to the generally negligible effects of unilateral or hands linked practice for all three actions in six experiments. One experiment showed significant effects in two of the three actions and the eighth in only one action. Improvements were clinically significant, normal performance ranges being reached for the majority of cases, with good maintenance at six-month follow-up. {\textcopyright} 1996 Demos Vermande.},

abstract = {Background and Objective. This study compared the efficacy of distributed constraint-induced therapy (dCIT), bilateral arm training (BAT), and control treatment (CT) on motor control and functional performance of the upper limb in stroke patients. Methods. A total of 66 patients with mean stroke onset of 16.20 months and mild to moderate motor impairment were randomized to dCIT, BAT, or CT groups. Each group received treatment for 2 h/d and 5 d/wk for 3 weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment measures included reaching kinematic variables in unilateral and bilateral tasks, the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), and the Motor Activity Log (MAL). Results. The dCIT and BAT groups had smoother reaching trajectories in the unilateral and bilateral tasks than the CT group. The BAT group, but not the dCIT group, generated greater force at movement initiation than the CT group during the unilateral and bilateral tasks. The dCIT patients had decreased WMFT time and higher functional ability scores than the CT patients. MAL results pointed to better performance in the amount and quality of use of the affected arm than BAT and CT patients. Conclusions. BAT and dCIT exhibited similar beneficial effects on movement smoothness but differential effects on force at movement initiation and functional performance. Therefore, BAT is a better option if improvement of force generation is the treatment goal, and dCIT is more appropriate for improving functional ability and use of the affected arm in daily life. These findings may assist in the planning of individually tailored rehabilitation therapies. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Traditional machine learning algorithms have made great achievements in data-driven fault diagnosis. However, they assume that all the data must be in the same working condition and have the same distribution and feature space. They are not applicable for real-world working conditions, which often change with time, so the data are hard to obtain. In order to utilize data in different working conditions to improve the performance, this paper presents a transfer learning approach for fault diagnosis with neural networks. First, it learns characteristics from massive source data and adjusts the parameters of neural networks accordingly. Second, the structure of neural networks alters for the change of data distribution. In the same time, some parameters are transferred from source task to target task. Finally, the new model is trained by a small amount of target data in another working condition. The Case Western Reserve University bearing data set is used to validate the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach. Experimental results show that the proposed transfer learning approach can improve the classification accuracy and reduce the training time comparing with the conventional neural network method when there are only a small amount of target data.},

abstract = {The use of activity-dependent interventions has shown some success in promoting recovery of upper limb function in chronic stroke patients. This study compared the neurophysiological and behavioural changes associated with two such rehabilitation protocols: unilateral and bilateral movement training. Twelve chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to the two training protocols involving six daily practice sessions. Each session consisted of 50 trials of a dowel placement task performed either with both impaired and unimpaired arm moving synchronously (bilateral training group) or with only the impaired arm moving (unilateral training). Kinematic measurements of upper limb movements were made in four unilateral test trials performed prior to and following each practice session. Functional assessments of the impaired upper limb and neurophysiological assessments, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), of the affected and non-affected cortical hemispheres were made prior to and following the intervention sessions. Individuals receiving bilateral training showed a reduction in movement time of the impaired limb and increased upper limb functional ability compared to individuals receiving unilateral training. In some patients changes to upper limb function were associated with changes to the cortical representation of a target muscle in the non-affected hemisphere. Overall, these findings suggest that a short-term bilateral training intervention may be effective in facilitating upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {According to the neuro-rehabilitation theory, compared with unilateral training, bilateral training is proven to be an effective method for hemiparesis, which affects the most part of stroke patients. In this study, a novel bilateral rehabilitation training system, which incorporates a lightweight exoskeleton device worn on the affected limb; a haptic device (Phantom Premium), which is used for generating a desired tactile feedback for the affected limb; and a VR (virtual reality) graphic interface, has been developed. The use of VR technology during rehabilitation can provide goal directed tasks with rewards and motivate the patient to undertake extended rehabilitation. This paper is mainly focused on elbow joint training, and other independent joints can be trained by easily changing the VR training interface. The haptic device is adopted to enable patients to use their own decision making abilities with a tactical feedback. Integrated with a VR-based graphic interface, the goal-oriented task can help to gradually recovery their motor function with a coordinative motion between two limbs. In particular, the proposed system can accelerate neural plasticity and motor recovery in those patients with little muscle strength by using the exoskeleton device. The exoskeleton device can provide from relatively high joint impedance to near-zero impedance, and can provide a partial assist as the patient requires.},

abstract = {The present study addressed the efficacy of concurrently moving both arms, with and without a load added to the uninvolved arm, in facilitating the quality of movement of the involved side in individuals with moderate, chronic hemiplegia. Six hemiplegic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) subjects with left-hemisphere lesions participated in the study. The four males and two females ranged from 46 to 77 years of age and 30-96 months post-CVA. All subjects scored at least 70{\%} on the Fugl-Meyer test of motor function. The task was to perform discrete unilateral and bilateral elbow extensions in the horizontal plane. The movements were 45 degrees in amplitude and were to terminate in a 10 degrees target zone that was indicated by an illustration of a coffee mug. The instructions were to move toward the mug as smoothly as possible in a movement time (MT) determined to be 20{\%} longer than their minimal MT for that distance. The primary dependent variable was the percentage of continuous vs. discontinuous trajectories observed in each condition, based on whether or not a transient hesitation or reversal was observed. Phase of peak velocity was also quantified as a general indication of the symmetry of the velocity profile. Three of the six subjects exhibited a greater percentage of continuous movements of the involved arm in the nonloaded bilateral condition than the unimanual condition. Five subjects benefited when the uninvolved arm was inertially loaded in the bilateral condition when compared with unimanual performance. Only the oldest subject failed to exhibit facilitation. Peak velocity phase tended to normalize toward symmetry in the bilateral conditions. These findings are consistent with prior evidence that the control of the involved arm improves during bimanual performance for some hemiplegic subjects. It further suggests loading the uninvolved arm may benefit some subjects with respect to unimanual performance, with age perhaps playing a role in determining efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This paper is focused on the multimodal analysis of patient performance, carried out by means of robotic technology and wearable sensors, and aims at providing quantitative measure of biomechanical and motion planning features of arm motor control following rehabilitation. Upper-limb robotic therapy was administered to 24 community- dwelling persons with chronic stroke. Performance indices on patient motor performance were computed from data recorded with the InMotion2 robotic machine and a magneto-inertial sensor. Motor planning issues were investigated by means of techniques of motion decomposition into submovements. A linear regression analysis was carried out to study correlation with clinical scales. Robotic outcome measures showed a significant improvement of kinematic motor performance; improvement of dynamic components was more significant in resistive motion and highly correlated with MP. The analysis of motion decomposition into submovements showed an important change with recovery of submovement number, amplitude and order, tending to patterns measured in healthy subjects. Preliminary results showed that arm biomechanical functions can be objectively measured by means of the proposed set of performance indices. Correlation with MP is high, while correlation with FM is moderate. Features related to motion planning strategies can be extracted from submovement analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

It is wearable and fully user-controlled, serving two possible roles: As a therapeutic tool that facilitates device-mediated hand exercises to recover neuromuscular function or as an assistive device for use in everyday activities to aid functional use of the hand. We present the clinical outcomes of a pilot study designed as a feasibility test for these hypotheses. 11 chronic stroke ({\textgreater}2 years) patients with moderate muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale ≤ 2 in upper extremity) engaged in a month-long training protocol using the orthosis. Individuals were evaluated using standardized outcome measures, both with and without orthosis assistance. Fugl-Meyer post intervention scores without robotic assistance showed improvement focused specifically at the distal joints of the upper limb, suggesting the use of the orthosis as a rehabilitative device for the hand. Action Research Arm Test scores post intervention with robotic assistance showed that the device may serve an assistive role in grasping tasks. These results highlight the potential for wearable and user-driven robotic hand orthoses to extend the use and training of the affected upper limb after stroke.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the difference between upper extremity deficits in subjects with left versus right hemispheric lesions at baseline and after bilateral arm training. Design: A one-way ANOVA was used to detect group differences and a least square means analysis used to determine significance in pre-to-post scores for each group. Setting: Testing was in the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science Department Research Laboratory, University of Maryland, Baltimore. Training was at the Senior Exercise Rehabilitation Center in the Veterans Administration Hospital, Baltimore. Subjects: Twenty-two (11 left hemispheric lesion, 11 right hemispheric lesion) right-handed subjects with chronic stroke. Interventions: A six-week nonprogressive repetitive bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC). Main measures: Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Test, Wolf Motor Arm Test, University of Maryland Arm Questionnaire for Stroke (UMAQS), isometric strength and active and passive range of motion for both sides. Results: No statistical differences were seen at baseline between groups in this sample. Both groups demonstrated improvement after BATRAC in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Test (change scores of those with left lesions = 5.5; right lesions = 3.6) and UMAQS (change scores of those with left lesions = 5 and right lesions = 2.9). Additionally, patients with left hemispheric lesions but not right lesions made improvements in the Wolf Motor Arm Test (time and weight), in strength measures of paretic elbow flexion, shoulder extension, shoulder abduction and nonparetic wrist flexion, wrist extension and shoulder abduction. Conclusions: There were no baseline motor function differences between those with left and right hemispheric lesions in this sample. There was a clear training response advantage for patients with left hemispheric lesions after completing six weeks of bilateral arm training. As a result, treatment approaches for upper extremity hemiparesis may need to be more specifically selected based on side of stroke. {\textcopyright} 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: To test whether training with a new mechanical arm trainer leads to better outcomes than electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist extensors in subacute stroke patients with severe upper limb paresis. Electrical stimulation is a standard and reimbursable form of therapy in Germany. Design: Randomized controlled trial of 54 inpatients enrolled 4-8 wks from stroke onset, mean upper-extremity subsection of Fugl-Meyer assessment (O-66) at admission less than 18. In addition to standard care, all patients practiced 20-30 mins arm trainer or electrical stimulation every workday for 6 wks, totaling 30 sessions. Primary outcome was the Fugl-Meyer assessment, second-ary outcomes were the Box and Block test, the Medical Research Council and the modified Ashworth scale, blindly assessed at enrollment, after 6 wks, and at 3-mo follow-up. Results: Both groups were homogeneous at study onset. Shoulder pain occurred in two arm trainer patients. The primary Fugl-Meyer assessment outcome improved for both groups over time (P {\textless} 0.001), but this improvement did not differ between groups. The initial (terminal) mean Fugl-Meyer assessment scores were 8.8 ± 4.8 (19.2 ± 14.5) for the arm trainer and 8.6 ± 3.5 (13.6 ± 7.9) for the electrical stimulation group. No patient could transport a block initially, but at completion significantly more arm trainer patients were able to transport at least three blocks (five vs. zero, P = 0.023). No significant differences were observed between the groups on the secondary Box and Block outcome at follow-up (eight vs. four patients). All Box and Block responders had an initial Fugl-Meyer assessment ≥ 10. Conclusions: Arm trainer training did not lead to a superior primary outcome over electrical stimulation training. However, "good performers" on the secondary outcome seemed to benefit more from the arm trainer training. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 by Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Background and purpose. There is little evidence available on the use of robot-assisted therapy in subacute stroke patients. A randomized controlled trial was carried out to evaluate the short-time efficacy of intensive robot-assisted therapy compared to usual physical therapy performed in the early phase after stroke onset. Methods. Fifty-three subacute stroke patients at their first-ever stroke were enrolled 30 ± 7 days after the acute event and randomized into two groups, both exposed to standard therapy. Additional 30 sessions of robot-assisted therapy were provided to the Experimental Group. Additional 30 sessions of usual therapy were provided to the Control Group.The following impairment evaluations were performed at the beginning (T0), after 15 sessions (T1), and at the end of the treatment (T2): Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FM), Modified Ashworth Scale-Shoulder (MAS-S), Modified Ashworth Scale-Elbow (MAS-E), Total Passive Range of Motion-Shoulder/Elbow (pROM), and Motricity Index (MI). Results: Evidence of significant improvements in MAS-S (p = 0.004), MAS-E (p = 0.018) and pROM (p {\textless} 0.0001) was found in the Experimental Group. Significant improvement was demonstrated in both Experimental and Control Group in FM (EG: p {\textless} 0.0001, CG: p {\textless} 0.0001) and MI (EG: p {\textless} 0.0001, CG: p {\textless} 0.0001), with an higher improvement in the Experimental Group. Conclusions: Robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation treatment can contribute to increasing motor recovery in subacute stroke patients. Focusing on the early phase of stroke recovery has a high potential impact in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sale et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel passive wrist bilateral rehabilitation device coupled with a new Virtual Reality (VR) platform. This is the first work to have adapted three-link coaxial spherical parallel manipulator (SPM) to wrist rehabilitation. The device comprises a coaxial SPM and cross-connected cable system. The coaxial SPM facilitates 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) spherical wrist orientation and singularity-free motion within its workspace. The cross-connected cable system enables bilateral symmetrical exercises in passive mode training. A VR platform with activities of daily living (ADL) task was developed and coupled with the device to increase the adherence of the users to the device. Experiments were conducted with fifteen healthy right-handed individuals with no history of wrist or hand injury to evaluate the feasibility of the system for providing passive bilateral training as well as the effectiveness of the VR platform. Subjects were asked to use their right arms to move the left arms passively through the device to perform four wrist movements, flexion, extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation. EMG activations on the left arm were observed when the right arm passively moved the left arm. The results showed that the device was capable of inducing the muscle activation of the left arm and the VR platform increased the motivation to continue the exercises. This demonstrates that this study can serve as the fundamental for larger clinical trials.},

abstract = {Bilateral rehabilitation training robotic systems have potential to promote the upper limb motor recovery of post-stroke hemiparesis patients through providing the synchronization motion between the impaired limb and contralateral limb. The active rehabilitation training based on patients' intention can also promote the recovery effect by stimulating the activity of the ipsilateral hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere. In this paper, a novel intention-based bilateral training system using biomedical signals which represents the muscle activity information and active motion intention was proposed to promote the rehabilitation training effect. The proposed system can provide the synchronization motion to the impaired limb by the exoskeleton device according to the sEMG signals from the contralateral intact limb. A BPNN model using a novel multi-features input vector was employed for establishing the relationship between the sEMG signals and the motion intention. To verify the intention prediction performance, the comparison experiments involving both the offline phase and online phase were carried out using three different kinds of feature input vectors of sEMG. Furthermore, the real-time bilateral control experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed bilateral rehabilitation system, in terms of motion synchronization tracking and the real-time characteristics.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose. This randomized controlled trial tests the efficacy of bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) versus dose-matched therapeutic exercises (DMTEs) on upper-extremity (UE) function in stroke survivors and uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine effects on cortical reorganization. Methods. A total of 111 adults with chronic UE paresis were randomized to 6 weeks (3×/week) of BATRAC or DMTE. Primary end points of UE assessments of Fugl-Meyer UE Test (FM) and modified Wolf Motor Function Test Time (WT) were performed 6 weeks prior to and at baseline, after training, and 4 months later. Pretraining and posttraining, fMRI for UE movement was evaluated in 17 BATRAC and 21 DMTE participants. Results. The improvements in UE function (BATRAC: FM $\Delta$ = 1.1 + 0.5, P = .03; WT $\Delta$ = -2.6 + 0.8, P {\textless} .00; DMTE: FM $\Delta$ = 1.9 + 0.4, P {\textless} .00; WT $\Delta$ = -1.6 + 0.7; P = .04) were comparable between groups and retained after 4 months. Satisfaction was higher after BATRAC than DMTE (P = .003). BATRAC led to significantly higher increase in activation in ipsilesional precentral, anterior cingulate and postcentral gyri, and supplementary motor area and contralesional superior frontal gyrus (P {\textless} .05). Activation change in the latter was correlated with improvement in the WMFT (P = .01). Conclusions. BATRAC is not superior to DMTE, but both rehabilitation programs durably improve motor function for individuals with chronic UE hemiparesis and with varied deficit severity. Adaptations in brain activation are greater after BATRAC than DMTE, suggesting that given similar benefits to motor function, these therapies operate through different mechanisms. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Background: The combination of robot-assisted therapy (RT) and a modified form of constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) shows promise for improving motor function of patients with stroke. However, whether the changes of motor control strategies are concomitant with the improvements in motor function after combination of RT and mCIT (RT + mCIT) is unclear. This study investigated the effects of the sequential combination of RT + mCIT compared with RT alone on the strategies of motor control measured by kinematic analysis and on motor function and daily performance measured by clinical scales. Methods: The study enrolled 34 patients with chronic stroke. The data were derived from part of a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants in the RT + mCIT and RT groups received 20 therapy sessions (90 to 105 min/day, 5 days for 4 weeks). Patients in the RT + mCIT group received 10 RT sessions for first 2 weeks and 10 mCIT sessions for the next 2 weeks. The Bi-Manu-Track was used in RT sessions to provide bilateral practice of wrist and forearm movements. The primary outcome was kinematic variables in a task of reaching to press a desk bell. Secondary outcomes included scores on the Wolf Motor Function Test, Functional Independence Measure, and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living. All outcome measures were administered before and after intervention. Results: RT + mCIT and RT demonstrated different benefits on motor control strategies. RT + mCIT uniquely improved motor control strategies by reducing shoulder abduction, increasing elbow extension, and decreasing trunk compensatory movement during the reaching task. Motor function and quality of the affected limb was improved, and patients achieved greater independence in instrumental activities of daily living. Force generation at movement initiation was improved in the patients who received RT. Conclusion: A combination of RT and mCIT could be an effective approach to improve stroke rehabilitation outcomes, achieving better motor control strategies, motor function, and functional independence of instrumental activities of daily living.},

Mean duration of study treatment was 8.6, 15.8, and 9.4 hours for the low-dose, high-dose, and control groups, respectively. Gains in the primary outcome measure were not significantly different between groups at follow- up. Significant correlations were found at discharge between FMA gains and the dose and intensity of RA. Intensity also correlated with FMA gain at 6 months. The high-dose group had greater FIM gains than controls at discharge and greater tone but no difference in FIM changes compared with low-dose subjects at 6 months. As used during acute rehabilitation, motor-control changes at follow-up were no less with MIME than with additional conventional therapy. Intensity of training with MIME was positively correlated with motor-control gains.},

abstract = {Background and Objective. This study investigated the relative effects of distributed constraint-induced therapy (CIT) and bilateral arm training (BAT) on motor performance, daily function, functional use of the affected arm, and quality of life in patients with hemiparetic stroke. Methods. A total of 60 patients were randomized to distributed CIT, BAT, or a control intervention of less specific but active therapy. Each group received intensive training for 2 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment measures included the Fuglĝ€"Meyer Assessment (FMA), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Activity Log (MAL), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The proximal and distal scores of FMA were used to examine separate upper limb (UL) elements of movement. Results. The distributed CIT and BAT groups showed better performance in the overall and the distal part score of the FMA than the control group. The BAT group exhibited greater gains in the proximal part score of the FMA than the distributed CIT and control groups. Enhanced performance was found for the distributed CIT group in the MAL, the subtest of locomotion in the FIM, and certain domains of the SIS (eg, ADL/IADL). Conclusion. BAT may uniquely improve proximal UL motor impairment. In contrast, distributed CIT may produce greater functional gains for the affected UL in subjects with mild to moderate chronic hemiparesis.},

abstract = {Background. Although bilateral arm training (BAT) has been widely studied, the comparative effects of therapist-based BAT (TBAT) versus robot-assisted BAT (RBAT) remains unknown. Objective. This study compared the efficacy of TBAT, RBAT, and a control treatment (CT) on motor control, functional performance, and quality of life after chronic stroke. Design. A randomized, pretest-posttest, control group design was used. Methods. Forty-two patients (mean age=54.49 years, SD=9.69; mean length of time since stroke onset=17.62 months, SD = 10.50) were randomly assigned to TBAT, RBAT, and CT groups. Each group received treatment for 90 to 105 minutes per session, 5 sessions on weekdays, for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included kinematic analyses, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Motor Activity Log, and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). Results. Large and significant effects were found in the kinematic variables, distal part of upper-limb motor impairment, and certain aspects of quality of life in favor of TBAT or RBAT. Specifically, the TBAT group demonstrated significantly better temporal efficiency and smoothness, straighter trunk motion, and less trunk compensation compared with the CT and RBAT groups. The RBAT group had increased shoulder flexion compared with the CT and TBAT groups. On the FMA, the TBAT group showed higher distal part scores than the CT group. On the SIS, the RBAT group had better strength subscale, physical function domain, and total scores than the CT group. Limitations. This study recruited patients with mild spasticity and without cognitive impairment. Conclusions. Compared with CT, TBAT and RBAT exhibited differential effects on outcome measures. Therapist-based BAT may improve temporal efficiency, smoothness, trunk control, and motor impairment of the distal upper limb. Robot-assisted BAT may improve shoulder flexion and quality of life. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Therapy Association.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - Overcoming chronic hemiparesis from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) can be challenging for many patients, especially after the first 12 months after the CVA. With the use of established motor control theories, the present study investigated electromyogram (EMG)-triggered neuromuscular stimulation and bilateral coordination training. Methods - Twenty-five CVA subjects volunteered to participate in this motor recovery protocol study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) coupled protocol of EMG-triggered stimulation and bilateral movement (n=10); (2) EMG-triggered stimulation and unilateral movement (n=10); or (3) control (n=5). All participants completed 6 hours of rehabilitation during a 2-week period according to group assignments. Motor capabilities of the wrist and fingers were evaluated on the basis of 3 categories of motor tasks in a pretest-posttest control group design. Results - Significant findings for the (1) number of blocks moved in a functional task, (2) chronometric reaction times to initiate movements, and (3) sustained muscle contraction capability all favored the coupled bilateral movement training and EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation protocol group. In addition, the unilateral movement/stimulation group exceeded the control group in the number of blocks moved and rapid onset of muscle contractions. Conclusions - This new evidence is convincing in that subjects in the coupled protocol group were able to demonstrate enhanced voluntary motor control across 3 categories of tasks. Chronic hemiparesis decreased considerably in the wrist and fingers as CVA patients expanded their motor repertoire.},

abstract = {Studies investigating whether simultaneous bilateral movements can facilitate performance of the impaired limb(s) of stroke patients have returned mixed results. In the present study we compared unilateral limb performance (amplitude, cycle duration) with performance during an interlimb coordination task involving both homologous (both arms, both legs) and non-homologous (one arm, one leg) limbs in stroke participants (n=7) and healthy age-matched controls (n=7). In addition, the effect of on-line augmented visual feedback on interlimb coordination was investigated. Participants performed cyclical flexion-extension movements of the arms and legs in the sagittal plane paced by an auditory metronome (1 Hz). Movement amplitudes were larger and cycle durations shorter during homologous limb coordination than non-homologous coordination. Compared with unilateral movements both groups had reduced movement amplitudes and the stroke group increased cycle duration when interlimb coordination tasks were performed. These effects were most evident during non-homologous (arm and leg) coordination. No evidence of facilitation of the impaired limb(s) was found in any of the interlimb coordination conditions. Augmented visual feedback had minimal effect on the movements of control participants but lead to an increase of cycle duration for stroke participants. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

From a frequentist/discriminative perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a Bayesian/generative perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is also known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

The basic idea behind the calculation of supportive force is to quantify the deficit in the dynamic equilibrium of the trunk. The proposed algorithm was implemented as a Kalman filter procedure and evaluated in a simulation environment. The simulation results proved the adequate and robust performance of "patient-driven" robot-assisted standing-up training.

abstract = {Background. No strongly clinical evidence about the use of hand robot-assisted therapy in stroke patients was demonstrated. This preliminary observer study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of intensive robot-assisted therapy in hand function recovery, in the early phase after a stroke onset. Methods. Seven acute ischemic stroke patients at their first-ever stroke were enrolled. Treatment was performed using Amadeo robotic system (Tyromotion GmbH Graz, Austria). Each participant received, in addition to inpatients standard rehabilitative treatment, 20 sessions of robotic treatment for 4 consecutive weeks (5 days/week). Each session lasted for 40 minutes. The exercises were carried out as follows: passive modality (5 minutes), passive/plus modality (5 minutes), assisted therapy (10 minutes), and balloon (10 minutes). The following impairment and functional evaluations, Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM), Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength (hand flexor and extensor muscles) (MRC), Motricity Index (MI), and modified Ashworth Scale for wrist and hand muscles (AS), were performed at the beginning (T0), after 10 sessions (T1), and at the end of the treatment (T2). The strength hand flexion and extension performed by Robot were assessed at T0 and T2. The Barthel Index and COMP (performance and satisfaction subscale) were assessed at T0 and T2. Results. Clinical improvements were found in all patients. No dropouts were recorded during the treatment and all subjects fulfilled the protocol. Evidence of a significant improvement was demonstrated by the Friedman test for the MRC (P{\textless}0.0123). Evidence of an improvement was demonstrated for AS, FM, and MI. Conclusions. This original rehabilitation treatment could contribute to increase the hand motor recovery in acute stroke patients. The simplicity of the treatment, the lack of side effects, and the first positive results in acute stroke patients support the recommendations to extend the clinical trial of this treatment, in association with physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Patrizio Sale et al.},

abstract = {An exoskeleton is an external structural mechanism with joints and links corresponding to those of the human body. With applications in rehabilitation medicine and virtual reality simulation, exoskeletons offer benefits for both disabled and healthy populations. A pilot database defining the kinematics and dynamics of the upper limb during daily living activities was one among several factors guiding the development of an anthropomorphic, 7-DOF, powered arm exoskeleton. Additional design inputs include anatomical and physiological considerations, workspace analyses, and upper limb joint ranges of motion. The database was compiled from 19 arm activities of daily living. The cable-actuated dexterous exoskeleton for neurorehabilitation (CADEN)-7 offers remarkable opportunities as a versatile human-machine interface and as a new generation of assistive technology. Proximal placement of motors and distal placement of cable-pulley reductions were incorporated into the design, leading to low inertia, high-stiffness links, and backdrivable transmissions with zero backlash. The design enables full glenohumeral, elbow, and wrist joint functionality. Potential applications of the exoskeleton as a wearable robot include: 1) a therapeutic and diagnostics device for physiotherapy, 2) an assistive (orthotic) device for human power amplifications, 3) a haptic device in virtual reality simulation, and 4) a master device for teleoperation. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted rehabilitation therapy has been proven to effectively improve upper limb motor function and daily behavior of patients with motor dysfunction, and the demand has increased at every stage of the rehabilitation recovery. According to the motor relearning program theory, upper limb motor dysfunction can be restored by a certain amount of repetitive training. Robotics devices can be an approach to accelerate the rehabilitation process by maximizing the patients' training intensity. This paper develops a new end-effector upper limb rehabilitation robot (EULRR) first and then presents a controller that is suitable for the assist-as-needed (AAN) training of the patients when performing the rehabilitation training. The AAN controller is a strategy that helps the patient's arm to stay close to the given trajectory while allowing for spatial freedom. This controller enables the patient's arm to have spatial freedom by constructing a virtual channel around the predetermined training trajectory. Patients could move their arm freely in the allowed virtual channel during rehabilitation training while the robot provides assistance when deviating from the virtual channel. The AAN controller is preliminarily tested with a healthy male subject in different conditions based on the EULRR. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AAN controller could provide assistance when moving out of the virtual channel and provide no assistance when moving along the trajectory within the virtual channel. In the close future, the controller is planned to be used in elderly volunteers and help to increase the intensity of the rehabilitation therapy by assisting the arm movement and by provoking active participation.},

abstract = {The single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL-SJ) robot is an exoskeleton-type suit developed for the neurorehabilitation of upper limb function. Several studies have addressed the usefulness of the robot; however, the appropriate patient selection remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the HAL-SJ exoskeleton in improving upper limb function in the subacute phase after a stroke, as a function of the severity of arm paralysis. Our analysis was based on a retrospective review of 35 patients, treated using the HAL-SJ exoskeleton in the subacute phase after their stroke, between October 2014 and December 2018. The severity of upper limb impairment was quantified using the Brunnstrom recovery stage (BRS) as follows: severe, BRS score 1–2, n = 10; moderate, BRS 3–4, n = 12; and mild, BRS 5–6, n = 13. The primary endpoint was the improvement in upper limb function, from baseline to post-intervention, measured using the Fugl-Meyer assessment upper limb motor score ($\Delta$FMA-UE; range 0–66). The $\Delta$FMA-UE score was significant for all three severity groups (P {\textless}0.05). The magnitude of improvement was greater in the moderate group than in the mild group (P {\textless}0.05). The greatest improvement was attained for patients with a moderate level of upper limb impairment at baseline. Our findings support the feasibility of the HAL-SJ to improve upper limb function in the subacute phase after a stroke with appropriate patient selection. This study is the first report showing the effect of robot-assisted rehabilitation using the HAL-SJ, according to the severity of paralysis in acute stroke patients with upper extremity motor deficits.},

abstract = {Background. Locomotor training using treadmills or robotic devices is commonly utilized to improve gait in cerebral palsy (CP); however, effects are inconsistent and fail to exceed those of equally intense alternatives. Possible limitations of existing devices include fixed nonvariable rhythm and too much limb or body weight assistance. Objective: To quantify and compare effectiveness of a motor-assisted cycle and a novel alternative, an elliptical, in CP to improve interlimb reciprocal coordination through intensive speed-focused leg training. Methods: A total of 27 children with bilateral CP, 5 to 17 years old, were randomized to 12 weeks of 20 minutes, 5 days per week home-based training (elliptical = 14; cycle = 13) at a minimum of 40 revolutions per minute, with resistance added when speed target was achieved. Primary outcomes were self-selected and fastest voluntary cadence on the devices and gait speed. Secondary outcomes included knee muscle strength, and selective control and functional mobility measures. Results: Cadence on trained but not nontrained devices increased, demonstrating task specificity of training and increased exercise capability. Mean gait speed did not increase in either group, nor did parent-reported functional mobility. Knee extensor strength increased in both. An interaction between group and time was seen in selective control with scores slightly increasing for the elliptical and decreasing for the cycle, possibly related to tighter limb coupling with cycling. Conclusions: Task-specific effects were similarly positive across groups, but no transfer was seen to gait or function. Training dose was low (≤20 hours) compared with intensive upper-limb training recommendations and may be insufficient to produce appreciable clinical change.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a nature inspired, meta-heuristic optimization technique to tune a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a robotic arm exoskeleton RAX-1. The RAX-1 is a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOFs) upper limb rehabilitation robotic system comprising two joints to facilitate shoulder joint movements. The conventional tuning of PID controllers using Ziegler-Nichols produces large overshoots which is not desirable for rehabilitation applications. To address this issue, nature inspired algorithms have recently been proposed to improve the performance of PID controllers. In this study, a 2-DOF PID control system is optimized offline using particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed ABC-PID method, several simulations were carried out comparing the ABC-PID controller with the PSO-PID and a classical PID controller tuned using the Zeigler-Nichols method. Various investigations, such as determining system performance with respect to maximum overshoot, rise and settling time and using maximum sensitivity function under disturbance, were carried out. The results of the investigations show that the ABC-PID is more robust and outperforms other tuning techniques, and demonstrate the effective response of the proposed technique for a robotic manipulator. Furthermore, the ABC-PID controller is implemented on the hardware setup of RAX-1 and the response during exercise showed minute overshoot with lower rise and settling times compared to PSO and Zeigler-Nichols-based controllers.},

abstract = {Transfer learning is an important approach in machine learning, which aims to solve a problem by utilising the knowledge learnt from another problem domain. There has been extensive research and great achievement on transfer learning for image analysis and other tasks, but research on transfer learning in genetic programming (GP) for symbolic regression is still in the very early stage. However, GP has a natural way of expressing knowledge by trees or subtrees, which can be automatically discovered during the evolutionary process. An initial work on GP with transfer learning was proposed to transfer knowledge through best trees or subtrees from to source domain to facilitate the learning in the target domain. However, there are still a number of important issues remaining not investigated. This paper further investigates the ability of GP with transfer learning on different types of transfer scenarios, investigates the influence of a key parameter and the effect of transfer learning on the evolutionary training process, and also analyses how the knowledge learnt from the source domain was utilised during the learning process on the target domain. The results show that GP with transfer learning can generally perform well on different types of transfer scenarios. The transferred knowledge can provide a good initial population for the GP learning on the target domain, speed up the convergence, and help obtain better final solutions. However, the benefits of transfer learning varies in different scenarios.},

abstract = {Objective: Individuals with neurological damage (e.g., stroke or cerebral palsy) often experience a significant loss of arm function. Robotic devices that address muscle strength deficits in a task-specific manner can assist in the recovery of arm function; however, current devices are typically large, bulky, and expensive to be routinely used in the clinic or at home. This study sought to address this issue by developing a portable planar passive rehabilitation robot, PaRRo. Methods: We designed PaRRo with a mechanical layout that incorporated kinematic redundancies to generate forces that directly oppose the user's movement. Cost-efficient eddy current brakes were used to provide scalable resistances. The lengths of the robots linkages were optimized to have a reasonably large workspace for human planar reaching. We then performed theoretical analysis of the robot's resistive force generating capacity and steerable workspace using MATLAB simulations. We also validated a prototype device by having a subject move the end-effector along different paths at a set velocity using a metronome while simultaneously collecting surface electromyography (EMG) and end-effector forces felt by the user. Results: Results from simulation experiments indicated that the robot was capable of producing sufficient end-effector forces for functional resistance training. We also found the end-effector forces from the user were similar to the theoretical forces expected at any direction of motion. EMG results indicated that the device was capable of providing adjustable resistances based on subjects' ability levels, as the muscle activation levels scaled with increasing magnet exposures. Conclusion: These results indicate that PaRRo is a feasible approach to provide functional resistance training to the muscles along the upper-extremity. Significance: The proposed robotic device could provide a technological breakthrough that will make rehabilitation robots accessible for small outpatient rehabilitation centers and in-home therapy.},

abstract = {In the recent past, several researchers have shown that important variables in relearning motor skills and in changing the underlying neural architecture after stroke are the quantity, duration, content, and intensity of training sessions. Unfortunately, when traditional therapy is provided in a hospital or rehabilitation center, the patient is usually seen for few hours a week. Robot-mediated therapies could improve this situation but even if interesting results have been achieved by several groups, the use of robot-mediated therapy has not become very common in clinical practice. This is due to many different reasons (e.g., the "technophobia" of some clinicians, the need for more extensive clinical trials) but one of the more important is the cost and the complexity of these devices which make them difficult to be purchased and used in all the clinical centers. The aim of this work was to verify the possibility of improving motor recovery of hemiparetic subjects by using a simple mechatronic system. To achieve this goal, our system (named "MEchatronic system for MOtor recovery after Stroke" (MEMOS)) has been designed with the aim of using mainly "off-the-shelf products" with only few parts simply manufactured with standard technology, when commercial parts were not available. Moreover, the prototype has been developed taking into account the requirements related to the clinical applicability such as robustness and safety. The MEMOSsystem has been used during clinical trials with subjects affected by chronic hemiparesis ({\textless}6 months from the cerebrovascular accident). The results obtained during these experiments seem to showthat notwithstanding the simple mechatronic structure characterizing theMEMOSsystem, it is able to help chronic hemiparetics to reduce their level of impairment. Further clinical experiments with acute and chronic subjects will be carried out in order to confirm these preliminary findings. Moreover, experiments for tele-rehabilitation of patients will be also carried out. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

This can address a challenge of conventional software-based rehabilitation systems, i.e., limited capability in adjusting the therapy. To guarantee human-robot interaction safety, a new design framework and a stabilizing controller are developed based on the small-gain approach. System stability and transparency are analyzed in the presence of the nonpassive, nonlinear, and nonautonomous behavior of the terminals (the therapist and the patient) and time-varying delays for the case of remote and cloud-based therapy. Several practical considerations have been taken into account to match the clinical needs and minimize the implementation cost.

abstract = {Recent neurological research indicates that the impaired motor skills of post-stroke patients can be enhanced and possibly restored through task-oriented repetitive training. This is due to neuroplasticity – the ability of the brain to change through adulthood. Various rehabilitation processes have been developed to take advantage of neuroplasticity to retrain neural pathways and restore or improve motor skills lost as a result of stroke or spinal cord injuries (SCI). Research in this area over the last few decades has resulted in a better understanding of the dynamics of rehabilitation in post-stroke patients and development of auxiliary devices and tools to induce repeated targeted body movements. With the growing number of stroke rehabilitation therapies, the application of robotics within the rehabilitation process has received much attention. As such, numerous mechanical and robot-assisted upper limb and hand function training devices have been proposed. A systematic review of robotic-assisted upper extremity (UE) motion rehabilitation therapies was carried out in this study. The strengths and limitations of each method and its effectiveness in arm and hand function recovery were evaluated. The study provides a comparative analysis of the latest developments and trends in this field, and assists in identifying research gaps and potential future work.},

abstract = {Background. Although bilateral arm training (BAT) has been widely studied, the comparative effects of therapist-based BAT (TBAT) versus robot-assisted BAT (RBAT) remains unknown. Objective. This study compared the efficacy of TBAT, RBAT, and a control treatment (CT) on motor control, functional performance, and quality of life after chronic stroke. Design. A randomized, pretest-posttest, control group design was used. Methods. Forty-two patients (mean age=54.49 years, SD=9.69; mean length of time since stroke onset=17.62 months, SD = 10.50) were randomly assigned to TBAT, RBAT, and CT groups. Each group received treatment for 90 to 105 minutes per session, 5 sessions on weekdays, for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included kinematic analyses, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Motor Activity Log, and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). Results. Large and significant effects were found in the kinematic variables, distal part of upper-limb motor impairment, and certain aspects of quality of life in favor of TBAT or RBAT. Specifically, the TBAT group demonstrated significantly better temporal efficiency and smoothness, straighter trunk motion, and less trunk compensation compared with the CT and RBAT groups. The RBAT group had increased shoulder flexion compared with the CT and TBAT groups. On the FMA, the TBAT group showed higher distal part scores than the CT group. On the SIS, the RBAT group had better strength subscale, physical function domain, and total scores than the CT group. Limitations. This study recruited patients with mild spasticity and without cognitive impairment. Conclusions. Compared with CT, TBAT and RBAT exhibited differential effects on outcome measures.

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a study of learning in a Hilbert space of vector−valued func-tions. We motivate the need for extending learning theory of scalar−valued functions by practical considerations and establish some basic results for learning vector−valued functions which should prove useful in applications. Specifically, we allow an output space Y to be a Hilbert space and we consider a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of functions whose values lie in Y. In this setting, we derive the form of the minimal norm interpolant to a finite set of data and apply it to study some regularization functionals which are important in learning theory. We consider specific examples of such functionals corresponding to multiple−output regularization networks and sup-port vector machines, both for regression and classification. Finally, we provide classes of operator−valued kernels of the dot product and translation invariant type.},

@article{Trlep2012,
abstract = {Background: Humans are capable of fast adaptation to new unknown dynamics that affect their movements. Such motor learning is also believed to be an important part of motor rehabilitation. Bimanual training can improve post-stroke rehabilitation outcome and is associated with interlimb coordination between both limbs. Some studies indicate partial transfer of skills among limbs of healthy individuals. Another aspect of bimanual training is the (a)symmetry of bimanual movements and how these affect motor learning and possibly post-stroke rehabilitation. Methods. A novel bimanual 2-DOF robotic system was used for both bimanual and unimanual reaching movements. 35 young healthy adults participated in the study. They were divided into 5 test groups that performed movements under different conditions (bimanual or unimanual movements and symmetric or asymmetric bimanual arm loads). The subjects performed a simple tracking exercise with the bimanual system. The exercise was developed to stimulate motor learning by applying a velocity-dependent disturbance torque to the handlebar. Each subject performed 255 trials divided into three phases: baseline without disturbance torque, training phase with disturbance torque and evaluation phase with disturbance torque. Results: Performance was assessed with the maximal values of rotation errors of the handlebar. After exposure to disturbance torque, the errors decreased for both unimanual and bimanual training. Errors in unimanual evaluation following the bimanual training phase were not significantly different from errors in unimanual evaluation following unimanual training. There was no difference in performance following symmetric or asymmetric training. Changing the arm force symmetry during bimanual movements from asymmetric to symmetric had little influence on performance. Conclusions: Subjects could adapt to an unknown disturbance torque that was changing the dynamics of the movements. The learning effect was present during both unimanual and bimanual training. Transfer of learned skills from bimanual training to unimanual movements was also observed, as bimanual training also improved single limb performance with the dominant arm. Changes of force symmetry did not have an effect on motor learning. As motor learning is believed to be an important mechanism of rehabilitation, our findings could be tested for future post-stroke rehabilitation systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Trlep et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In this study, we want to get a stronger evidence to verify the robustness of the proposed system, controller and recovery strategy as well as to further investigate the possibility of bilateral trainings for clinical applications. To this end, ten healthy subjects took part in a 60-minute experiment. Trajectories of robots and interaction force were recorded under the proposed bilateral recovery strategy which contained four exercise modes. For mode-l and mode-2, results showed that the trajectories of master and slave robots can catch the reference trajectory very well, and be changed with active interaction force applied by participants. For mode-3 and mode-4, participants finished tasks very well by drawing the 'square-shaped' trajectories through their own force. In conclusion, the experimental results were good enough to provide a strong and positive evidence for the proposed system and controller. Moreover, according to the feedbacks from participants, the bilateral recovery strategy can be treated as a new and interesting training as compared to the traditional unilateral training, and could be tested in clinical applications further.},

abstract = {Study Design: An iterative design process was used to obtain design parameters that satisfy both kinematic and dynamic requirements for the hand exoskeleton. This design was validated through experimental studies. Introduction: The success of hand rehabilitation after impairments depends on the timing, intensity, repetition, and frequency, as well as task-specific training. Considering the continuing constraints placed on therapist-led rehabilitation and need for better outcomes, robot-assisted rehabilitation has been explored. Soft robotic approaches have been implemented for a hand rehabilitation exoskeleton as they have more tolerance for alignment with biological joints than those of hard exoskeletons. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to design, develop, and validate a soft robotic exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation. Methods: A motion capture system validated the kinematics of the soft robotic digit attached on top of a human index finger. A pneumatic control system and algorithms were developed to operate the exoskeleton based on three therapeutic modes: continuous passive, active assistive, and active resistive motion. Pilot studies were carried out on one healthy and one poststroke participant using continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy modes. Results: The soft robotic digits were able to produce required range of motion and accommodate for dorsal lengthening, with trajectories of the center of rotation of the soft robotic joints in close agreement with the center of rotation of the human finger joints. Discussion: The exoskeleton showed the robust performance of the robot in applying continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy. Conclusions: This soft robotic exoskeleton is promising for assisting in the rehabilitation of the hand.},

abstract = {Background: Although the effects of robot-assisted arm training after stroke are promising, the relative effects of unilateral (URT) vs. bilateral (BRT) robot-assisted arm training remain uncertain. This study compared the effects of URT vs. BRT on upper extremity (UE) control, trunk compensation, and function in patients with chronic stroke. Method. This was a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The intervention was implemented at 4 hospitals. Fifty-three patients with stroke were randomly assigned to URT, BRT, or control treatment (CT). Each group received UE training for 90 to 105 min/day, 5 days/week, for 4 weeks. The kinematic variables for arm motor control and trunk compensation included normalized movement time, normalized movement units, and the arm-trunk contribution slope in unilateral and bilateral tasks. Motor function and daily function were measured by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Motor Activity Log (MAL), and ABILHAND Questionnaire. Results: The BRT and CT groups elicited significantly larger slope values (i.e., less trunk compensation) at the start of bilateral reaching than the URT group. URT led to significantly better effects on WMFT-Time than BRT. Differences in arm control kinematics and performance on the MAL and ABILHAND among the 3 groups were not significant. Conclusions: BRT and URT resulted in differential improvements in specific UE/trunk performance in patients with stroke. BRT elicited larger benefits than URT on reducing compensatory trunk movements at the beginning of reaching. In contrast, URT produced better improvements in UE temporal efficiency. These relative effects on movement kinematics, however, did not translate into differential benefits in daily functions. Trial registration.

During the learning of new skills, cortical regions associated with sensorimotor function of the body parts most utilized for the skilled task come to be represented over larger cortical territories. More recent studies have shown that functional and structural changes take place in the cerebral cortex after injury, such as occurs after stroke or trauma. These two modulators of cortical function, sensorimotor learning and cortical injury, interact. Thus, after cortical injury, the structure and function of undamaged parts of the brain are remodeled during recovery, shaped by the sensorimotor experiences of the individual in the weeks to months following injury. These recent neuroscientific findings suggest that new rehabilitative interventions, both physiotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic, may have benefit via modulation of neuroplastic mechanisms.},

abstract = {Background. A recent Cochrane Review showed that early robotic training of the upper limb in stroke survivors can be more effective than other interventions when improving activities of daily living involving the arm function is the aim of therapy. Objective. We tested for efficacy of the study a protocol which involved the use of the NeReBot therapy in partial substitution of standard upper limb rehabilitation in post-acute stroke patients. Methods. In this dose-matched, randomized controlled clinical trial, 34 hemiparetic participants with movement against gravity in shoulder, elbow, and wrist muscle groups were enrolled within 15 days of the onset of stroke. All participants received a total daily rehabilitation treatment for 120 minutes, 5 days per week for 5 weeks. The control group received standard therapy for the upper limb. The experimental group received standard therapy (65{\%} of exercise time) associated with robotic training (35{\%} of exercise time). Muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale), strength (Medical Research Council), and synergism (Fugl-Meyer motor scores) were measured at impairment level, whereas dexterity (Box and Block Test and Frenchay Arm Test) and activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure) were measured at activity level. All assessments were performed at baseline, at the end of therapy (time T1), at 3 months (time T2), and at 7 months (time T3) after entry. All between-group analyses were tested using nonparametric test with Bonferroni's adjustments for multiple testing. Results. No significant between-group differences were found with respect to demographic characteristics, motor, dexterity, and ADLs at baseline, postintervention (T1) and at follow-up (T2 and T3). Conclusions. The robot therapy by NeReBot did not lead to better outcomes compared with conventional inpatient rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose - To compare a computerized arm trainer (AT), allowing repetitive practice of passive and active bilateral forearm and wrist movement cycle, and electromyography-initiated electrical stimulation (ES) of the paretic wrist extensor in severely affected subacute stroke patients. Method - A total of 44 patients, 4 to 8 weeks after stroke causing severe arm paresis (Fugl-Meyer Motor Score [FM, O to 66] {\textless}18), were randomly assigned to either AT or ES. All patients practiced 20 minutes every workday for 6 weeks. AT patients performed 800 repetitions per session with the robot and ES patients performed 60 to 80 wrist extensions per session. The primary outcome measure was the blindly assessed FM (0 to 66), and the secondary measures were the upper limb muscle power (Medical Research Council [MRC] sum, 0 to 45) and muscle tone (Ashworth score sum, 0 to 25), assessed at the beginning and end of treatment and at 3-month follow-up. Results - The AT group had a higher Barthel Index score at baseline, but the groups were otherwise homogenous. As expected, FM and MRC sum scores improved overtime in both groups but significantly more in the robot AT group. The initial Barthel Index score had no influence. In the robot AT group, FM score was 15 points higher at study end and 13 points higher at 3-month follow-up than the control ES group. MRC sum score was 15 points higher at study end and at 3-month follow-up compared with the control ES group. Muscle tone remained unchanged, and no side effects occurred. Conclusion - The computerized active arm training produced a superior improvement in upper limb motor control and power compared with ES in severely affected stroke patients. This is probably attributable to the greater number of repetitions and the bilateral approach. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel electromyography (EMG)-driven hand exoskeleton for bilateral rehabilitation of grasping in stroke. The developed hand exoskeleton was designed with two distinctive features: (a) kinematics with intrinsic adaptability to patient's hand size, and (b) free-palm and free-fingertip design, preserving the residual sensory perceptual capability of touch during assistance in grasping of real objects. In the envisaged bilateral training strategy, the patient's non paretic hand acted as guidance for the paretic hand in grasping tasks. Grasping force exerted by the non paretic hand was estimated in real-time from EMG signals, and then replicated as robotic assistance for the paretic hand by means of the hand-exoskeleton. Estimation of the grasping force through EMG allowed to perform rehabilitation exercises with any, non sensorized, graspable objects. This paper presents the system design, development, and experimental evaluation. Experiments were performed within a group of six healthy subjects and two chronic stroke patients, executing robotic-assisted grasping tasks. Results related to performance in estimation and modulation of the robotic assistance, and to the outcomes of the pilot rehabilitation sessions with stroke patients, positively support validity of the proposed approach for application in stroke rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Introduction. In stroke rehabilitation, bilateral upper limb training is gaining ground. As a result, a growing number of mechanical and robotic bilateral upper limb training devices have been proposed. Objective. To provide an overview and qualitative evaluation of the clinical applicability of bilateral upper limb training devices. Methods. Potentially relevant literature was searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases from 1990 onwards. Devices were categorized as mechanical or robotic (according to the PubMed MeSH term of robotics). Results. In total, 6 mechanical and 14 robotic bilateral upper limb training devices were evaluated in terms of mechanical and electromechanical characteristics, supported movement patterns, targeted part and active involvement of the upper limb, training protocols, outcomes of clinical trials, and commercial availability. Conclusion. Initial clinical results are not yet of such caliber that the devices in question and the concepts on which they are based are firmly established. However, the clinical outcomes do not rule out the possibility that the concept of bilateral training and the accompanied devices may provide a useful extension of currently available forms of therapy. To actually demonstrate their (surplus) value, more research with adequate experimental, dose-matched designs, and sufficient statistical power are required. {\textcopyright} 2012 A. (Lex) E.

This is a critical requirement of completely modelled settings, which can often be difficult to justify. We propose a strategy to overcome this. The methodology relies on fully probabilistic design to develop a target algorithm which accepts source knowledge in the form of a probability distribution. We present this incompletely modelled setting in the supervised learning context where the source and target tasks are to perform Gaussian process regression. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the transfer of the source distribution substantially improves prediction performance of the target learner when recovering a distorted nonparametric function realization from noisy data.},

abstract = {In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we assessed the neural network governing bimanual coordination during manipulations of spatiotemporal complexity and cycling frequency. A parametric analysis was applied to determine the effects of each of both factors as well as their interaction. Subjects performed four different cyclical movement tasks of increasing spatiotemporal complexity (i.e., unimanual left-right hand movements, bimanual in-phase movements, bimanual anti-phase movements, and bimanual 90° out-of-phase movements) across four frequency levels (0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 Hz). Results showed that, within the network involved in bimanual coordination, functional subcircuits could be distinguished: Activation in the supplementary motor area, superior parietal cortex (SPS), and thalamic VPL Nc was mainly correlated with increasing spatiotemporal complexity of the limb movements, suggesting that these areas are involved in higher-order movement control. By contrast, activation within the primary motor cortex, cingulate motor cortex (CMC), globus pallidus, and thalamic VLo Nc correlated mainly with movement frequency, indicating that these areas play an important role during movement execution. Interestingly, the cerebellum and the dorsal premotor cortex were identified as the principal regions responding to manipulation of both parameters and exhibiting clear interaction effects. Therefore, it is concluded that both areas represent critical sites for the control of bimanual coordination. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the development of neurorehabilitation, physical rehabilitation strategies for the upper limbs have become gradually accepted by therapists and researchers. These strategies include intensive intervention, task-oriented training, and bilateral training. Most upper limb rehabilitation systems have been developed for unilateral training. This paper develops an upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation device (ULERD) that can be used for bilateral training. The device has three active degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the elbow and wrist joints, and an additional four passive DoFs at these joints to correct any misalignment between the human and device joints. A bilateral training strategy is implemented with the developed ULERD and a haptic device according to neurorehabilitation theory. In a preliminary study, a healthy user was able to manipulate the haptic device with one hand (intact hand for hemiplegic patients) when the upper arm was fixed, and the ULERD assisted in moving the other hand (impaired upper limb for hemiplegic patients). To implement bilateral training, the kinematics of one upper limb (intact limb) and the haptic device is analyzed, respectively. The angles of the three active DoFs are determined via integration. An inertia sensor is used to evaluate the kinematics resolution. The ULERD was evaluated by experienced therapists during the design process to determine its potential for clinic application. Experimental results indicate that the kinematics resolution is effective and that this type of bilateral movement can be implemented using the ULERD and the haptic device.},

abstract = {Functional cortical reorganisation had been demonstrated to accompany recovery from motor stroke. In agreement with a previous study, quantitative kinematic analysis of aimed movements in 14 almost completely recovered hemiparetic stroke patients and 14 healthy control subjects indicated a reduced skilfulness of both the more ballistic initial movement phase and the more feedback-guided late homing-in phase of aimed movements. By means of two dual motor tasks it was further investigated whether the reduced skilfulness of patients was due to an increased attentional demand and thus a reduced automaticity of motor control. Interference effects by dual tasks, however, were similar for patients and control subjects. Thus, the notion of reduced automaticity could not be supported empirically, and reduced skilfulness seemed rather related to residual pyramidal motor deficits. By means of a repetitive daily training for 1 week based on the Arm Ability Training approach, patients were able to reduce their performance deficits in both movement phases significantly. Whether patients practised with the affected arm or simultaneously with both the affected and non-affected arm only marginally modified outcome, unilateral training being slightly more efficacious. These findings demonstrate that even clinically minor residual motor deficits can be improved by a structured training for the affected arm. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Background/Objective: To determine whether a new upper extremity exercise device integrated with a video game (GameCycle) requires sufficient metabolic demand and effort to induce an aerobic training effect and to explore the feasibility of using this system as an exercise modality in an exercise intervention. Design: Pre-post intervention. Setting: University-based research facility. Subject Population: A referred sample of 8 adolescent subjects with spina bifida (4 girls, 15.5 ± 0.6 years; 4 boys 17.5 ± 0.9 years) was recruited to participate in the project. All subjects had some level of mobility impairment that did not allow them to participate in mainstream sports available to their nondisabled peers. Five subjects used a wheelchair full time, one used a wheelchair occasionally, but walked with forearm crutches, and 2 were fully ambulatory, but had impaired gait. Main Outcome Measures: Peak oxygen uptake, maximum work output, aerobic endurance, peak heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, and user satisfaction. Results: Six of the 8 subjects were able to reach a Vo2 of at least 50{\%} of their Vo2 reserve while using the GameCycle. Seven of the 8 subjects reached a heart rate of at least 50{\%} of their heart rate reserve. One subject did not reach either 50{\%} of Vo2 reserve or 50{\%} of heart rate reserve. Seven of the 8 subjects increased their maximum work capability after training with the GameCycle at least 3 times per week for 16 weeks. Conclusions: The data suggest that the GameCycle seems to be adequate as an exercise device to improve oxygen uptake and maximum work capability in adolescents with lower extremity disability caused by spinal cord dysfunction. The subjects in this study reported that the video game component was enjoyable and provided a motivation to exercise.},

abstract = {Aim The aim of this study was to determine whether constraint-induced movement therapy is more effective than bimanual training in improving the quality of life of children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP). Method Sixty-three children (mean age 10y 2mo [SD 2y 6mo]; 33 males, 30 females) with CP of the spastic motor type (n=59) or with spasticity and dystonia (n=4) were randomly allocated to two groups. The children were assessed as Manual Ability Classification System level I (n=16), II (n=46), or III (n=1). Each group received 6hours of daily intervention (either constraint-induced movement therapy [CIMT] or bimanual training [BIM]) for 10days over a 2-week period (total intervention time 60h). Children aged 9years and older completed the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children (CPQOL-Child) and those aged 8years and older completed the KIDSCREEN-52. All parents completed proxy versions of each measure. Assessments were made at baseline and at 3, 26, and 52weeks after the end of the intervention. Results Thirty-five children completed the CPQOL-Child and 41 completed the KIDSCREEN-52. No changes in social or emotional well-being were reported by children in either group. Children and parents from both groups reported a significant improvement in their or their child's feelings about functioning as well as participation and physical health on the CPQOL-Child. The parents of children receiving CIMT reported positive and sustained changes in their child's social well-being (CPQOL-Child). The CIMT group showed significant improvements in physical well-being, psychological well-being, and moods and emotions (KIDSCREEN-52) at 3weeks post intervention, which were maintained over the study period. Interpretation Intensive goal-directed upper limb training programmes using either CIMT or BIM achieved domain-specific changes in quality of life relating to feelings about functioning and participation and physical health. A condition-specific quality of life compared with a generic measure may be better able to detect changes in quality of life in children with unilateral CP. {\textcopyright} The Authors.

Possible adverse effects of abnormal muscle tone, pain, and fatigue were recorded. All groups showed large improvements in motor recovery and individual goals. Significant between-group differences were found on GAS favoring the hybrid groups but not on FMA and CAHAI. No adverse effects were reported. Hybrid therapies are safe and applicable interventions for chronic stroke and favorable for improving individual functional goals. Treatment effects on motor recovery and functional activity might be similar among the three groups.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted training is increasingly being investigated in upper limb rehabilitation for individuals with stroke. Many studies have suggested that an appropriate synchronization of voluntary motor commands and limb movement is critical for long-term efficacy. Bimanual training is one method for enhancing this synchronization or motor coordination. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of bimanual robot-assisted movements by comparing the relative timing of muscle activation and forces to those generated during unimanual robot-assisted movement. A secondary goal was to compare bimanual robot-assisted movement to bimanual voluntary movement, where both limbs moved independently without robotics. Subjects performed reaching tasks while attached to one or two robotic manipulators. A predefined movement trajectory was prescribed during unimanual robot-assisted movement; in bimanual robot-assisted movement the paretic limb trajectory mirrored the nonparetic limb. Relative to unimanual movements, during bimanual movements the timing of muscle activation and initial interface forces was more similar to the nonparetic limb. However, there were limited differences in these measures between bimanual voluntary and bimanual robot-assisted movements. Bimanual robot-assisted movements resulted in superior motor coordination compared to unimanual movements and could be beneficial for individuals with a restricted movement range. Bimanual movements without robotics were just as efficacious and may be preferred for individuals who can generate movement without assistance. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Purpose. Stroke is a leading cause of disability with many survivors having upper limb (UL) hemiparesis. UL rehabilitation using bilateral exercise enhances outcomes and the Bilateral Upper Limb Trainer (BUiLT) was developed to provide symmetrical, bilateral arm exercise in a 'forced' and self-assistive manner, incorporating virtual reality (VR) to provide direction and task specificity to users as well as action observationexecution and greater motivation to exercise. Methods. The BUiLT + VR system was trialled on five post-stroke participants with UL hemiparesis: one sub-acute and four chronic. The intervention was supplied for 45min, 4 days/week for 6 weeks. The Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity score (FMA-UE) was used as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures used were UL isometric strength and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire. Results. The BUiLT + VR therapy increased FMA-UE scores from 1 to 5 and overall strength in the shoulder and elbow. Motivation at the end of intervention was positive. Conclusions.Therapy using the BUiLT + VR system is reliable, can be administered safely and has a positive trend of benefit as measured by the FMA-UE, isometric strength testing and IMI questionnaire. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Impaired: arm function and loss of manual dexterity can lead to decreased independence in activities of daily living in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this study we verified the feasibility and efficacy of a serious games approach to supervised upper limb rehabilitation of the more affected arm in persons with MS and the cross-over effect to the nontreated arm. Methods: Eighteen persons with moderate to severe MS symptoms participated (mean age 56.1 (range 28–73) years; mean disease duration 17.6 (4–35) years). Each participant received 12 supervised sessions of serious games (45 min, 12 sessions) aimed at improving the most affected upper limb. Primary outcomes were the Nine Hole Peg Test (9HPT) and the Box and Blocks Test (BBT). Perceived health was evaluated pre and post intervention with SF-12 and the VAS of the EuroQual-5DL. Non parametric tests were used and P was set at 0.05. Results: After the serious games training participants improved dexterity and arm function bilaterally (10–18{\%}), however, there was a statistically significant improvement only in the treated arm (P{\textless}0.05). Perceived menthal health improved follwing training (P{\textless}0.05) but not perceived physical health. Conclusion: An in clinic intervention with a serious-games virtual reality approach positively influenced arm recovery in persons moderately to severely affected by MS, improving mainly the treated arm but with positive effects on the nontreated arm. The persons were motivated during the intervention and expressed being willing to continue this kind of training at home as part of continuity of care.},

It aims to compare and discuss the potentials of these different control algorithms, and specify future research direction. Included studies mainly come from selected papers in four review articles. To make selected studies complete and comprehensive, especially some recently-developed upper-limb robotic devices, a search was further conducted in IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science using keywords (‘upper limb*' or ‘upper body*') and (‘rehabilitation*' or ‘treatment*') and (‘robot*' or ‘device*' or ‘exoskeleton*'). The search is limited to English-language articles published between January 2013 and December 2017. Valuable references in related publications were also screened. Comparative analysis shows that high-level interaction control strategies can be implemented in a range of methods, mainly including impedance/admittance based strategies, adaptive control techniques, and physiological signal control. Even though the potentials of existing interactive control strategies have been demonstrated, it is hard to identify the one leading to maximum encouragement from human users. However, it is reasonable to suggest that future studies should combine different control strategies to be application specific, and deliver appropriate robotic assistance based on physical disability levels of human users.},

The basic principle of motor function recovery is the medical theoretical basis of robot-assisted rehabilitation training, and contains two aspects, one is that the central nervous system has a high degree of plasticity after the brain injury, and the other is that motor function recovery can be achieved through motor relearning programme. Based on the analysis of the human upper limb, the design of the upper limb rehabilitation robot with an exoskeleton structure and three degrees of freedom (DOFs) that resembles the human upper limb was completed. According to the medical theory, robot-in-charge and patient-in-charge training models were developed for exercise therapy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Twenty-six stroke survivors with chronic hemiparesis were randomly assigned to the stimulation duration groups, and subjects completed 4 days of rehabilitation training over a 2-week period. Mixed design analyses of variance on the Box and Block scores, chronometric reaction times, and force modulation of the sustained muscle contraction task revealed distinct motor recovery improvements for both the 5 and 10 s stimulation duration groups in comparison to the 0 s duration control group. Further, the number of blocks moved by the 10-s duration group exceeded those moved by the 5-s duration group. In conclusion, the 5 and 10 s duration active stimulation/bilateral movement groups decreased residual motor dysfunctions that persisted beyond 12 months post stroke. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Various instruments are used to describe poststroke functional outcome, with limited consensus as to optimal end-point for clinical trial use. Many of the popular assessment tools are administered with little formal guidance on best practice. Thus there is potential for substantial heterogeneity in functional outcome assessment poststroke, with consequent effects on trial quality. We examined functional assessment methodology in recent stroke trials. We reviewed six journals representing high-impact international publications in the fields of: stroke (Stroke); neurology (Neurology, Lancet Neurology) and internal medicine (Lancet, New England Journal Medicine; Journal of the American Medical Association). Journals were hand searched for all interventional studies in stroke patients between 2001 and 2006 inclusive. Chosen manuscripts were then analyzed for outcome assessment methodology. We identified 126 trials, comprising a mix of early hypothesis generating studies through to multi-centre trials (phase I: four trials; phase II: 46 trials; phase III: 20 trials; noninvestigational medicinal product studies: 56 trials). The median number of patients assessed per trial was 100. Across the trials, 47 different outcome measures were used. One hundred trials had functional outcome assessment as the primary study end-point. The median number of outcome measures was two per trial (range 1-9). The modified Rankin scale was the most prevalent outcome assessment (64.3{\%}); followed by Barthel index (40.5{\%}). A minority of trials (33.3{\%}) provided full details on outcome assessment methodology. Among these trials there was substantial heterogeneity in data collection procedures. There is heterogeneity in the use of functional outcome measures in stroke trials. This compromises comparison and meta-analysis. Trialists continue to use poorly validated approaches to outcome assessment. Given the potential effects on data quality, explicit description of methodology should be mandatory for all trials and rigour is desirable. {\textcopyright} 2009 World Stroke Organization.},

Pilot studies suggest the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation and bilateral robotic training to enhance gains. Objective. In a double-blind, randomized trial the combination of these interventions was tested. Methods. This study randomized 96 patients with an ischemic supratentorial lesion of 3 to 8 weeks' duration with severe impairment of motor control with a Fugl-Meyer score (FMS) for the upper limb {\textless}18 into 3 groups. For 6 weeks, group A received anodal stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere, group B received cathodal stimulation of the nonlesioned side for 20 minutes at 2.0 mA, and group C received sham stimulation. The electrodes were placed over the hand area and above the contralateral orbit. Contemporaneously, the subjects practiced 400 repetitions each of 2 different bilateral movements on a robotic assistive device. Results. The groups were matched at onset. The FMS improved in all patients at 6 weeks (P {\textless}.001). No between-group differences were found; initial versus finish FMS scores were 7.8 ± 3.8 versus 19.1 ± 14.4 in group A, 7.9 ± 3.4 versus 18.8 ± 10.5 in group B, and 8.2 ± 4.4 versus 19.2 ± 15.0 in group C. No significant changes between groups were present at 3 months. Conclusions. Neither anodal nor cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhanced the effect of bilateral arm training in this exploratory trial of patients with cortical involvement and severe weakness. Unilateral hand training and upregulation of the nonlesioned hemisphere might also be tried in this population. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

Budget constrains limit a hand-to-hand therapy approach, so that intelligent machines may offer a solution to further promote motor recovery and to better understand motor control. This new field of automated or robot-assisted motor rehabilitation has emerged since the nineties. The article presents clinically viable devices for the upper and lower extremity rehabilitation, which have been developed by our group. The Bi-Manu-Track, enables the bilateral practice of a forearm and wrist movement, and is currently tested. For gait rehabilitation after stroke, the electromechanical gait trainer GT I has proven effective as compared to treadmill training with Body weight support (BWS). The latest development is the HapticWalker, a robotic walking simulator for gait training, which allows the training of arbitrary daily life foot trajectories. The foot trajectories can be individually adjusted to each patient, in addition the machine will offer a sophisticated patient-machine-interaction. A prototype of the machine has been designed and built succesfully and is being evaluated at present. Technical possibilities are one aspect, but multi-centre trials and the consideration of unsubstantiated fears among therapists of being replaced by the machines will decide on the successful implementation of this most promising field to the benefit of patients.},

abstract = {The group at Klinik Berlin/Charite University Hospital in Berlin, Germany, began studies to promote motor recovery after stroke in the early 1990s. Following the introduction of treadmill training with partial body-weight support, the group designed an electromechanical gait trainer, GT I, based on movable foot plates that relieve therapist effort (e.g., when assisting the movement of the paretic limbs) and intensify patient gait training (GT). Preliminary results of a recent multicenter trial of 155 acute stroke patients showed that the GT I effectively promotes gait ability and competence in activities of daily living. The experimental group received 20 min of GT and 25 min of physiotherapy (PT) and the control group received 45 min of PT every day for 4 weeks. The laboratory's next step was the HapticWalker, a robotic walking simulator with freely programmable foot plates so that patients can, for example, additionally train for stair climbing and perturbations. The foot plates can be operated in full guidance or compliance control modes, thus reducing foot support according to the patient's learning success. For the severely affected upper limb, the laboratory's computerized arm trainer, called the Bi-Manu-Track, enables bilateral practice of forearm pronation/supination and wrist flexion/extension. Compared with electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist extensors, acute stroke patients with severe arm paresis (n = 44) had significantly more upper-limb muscle strength and control at the end of the 6-week intervention period and at follow-up. The laboratory's most recent and cost-effective development, the Nudelholz, is a purely mechanical device that bilaterally trains the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. It is intended for home therapy.},

Objective. To evaluate changes in upper limb function and EEG power after a robot-assisted BAT in chronic stroke patients. Methods. In a within-subject design, seven right-handed chronic stroke patients with upper limb paresis received 21 sessions (3 days/week) of the robot-assisted BAT. The outcomes were changes in score on the upper limb section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM), Motricity Index (MI), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) evaluated at the baseline (T0), posttraining (T1), and 1-month follow-up (T2). Event-related desynchronization/synchronization were calculated in the upper alpha and the beta frequency ranges. Results. Significant improvement in all outcomes was measured over the course of the study. Changes in FM were significant at T2, and in MAS at T1 and T2. After training, desynchronization on the ipsilesional sensorimotor areas increased during passive and active movement, as compared with T0. Conclusions. A repetitive robotic-assisted BAT program may improve upper limb motor function and reduce spasticity in the chronically impaired paretic arm. Effects on spasticity were associated with EEG changes over the ipsilesional sensorimotor network.},

abstract = {Modal impact hammer comprised of a force transducer, a hammer body and different impact tips, is widely used in structural dynamic testing. Users might usually overlook the sensitivity of the impact hammer since it has no influence on the estimation of modal frequency, damping, and mode shape in a Multiple Reference Impact Test (MRIT). However, for the reason of accurate measurement and analysis for estimating the modal scaling factor or measuring the inertial mass of the structure, the calibration process has to be performed in advance. For the majority of off-the-shelf impact hammers, the force transducer cannot be detached. Moreover, the sensitivity of the integrated force transducer is not identical with the hammer because the force is transferred from the sensor to the structure via the impact tip. Therefore, the calibration method for common force transducers is not suitable for the impact hammer. In this paper, on the basis of drop calibration, two practical methods using an accelerometer and a load ceil are presented respectively to calibrate the impact hammer and findings are compared with each other. The influence of different impact tips to the sensitivity of the hammer is also discussed.},

This study investigated patterns of electromyogram (EMG) activation levels while stroke subjects voluntarily initiated their impaired wrist and finger extensor muscles. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to either a unilateral movement/stimulation group or a bilateral movement/stimulation group. Participants completed 4 days (6 h over 2 weeks) of active neuromuscular stimulation (i.e., 5 s/trial, 90 trials/day, biphasic waveform) on the wrist and finger extensors according to group assignments. The EMG activation levels were analyzed with a three-factor mixed design Motor recovery protocol×Session block×Trial block (2×2×3) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second and third factors. This robust analysis revealed higher EMG activation levels for the coupled bilateral movement/stimulation group than the unilateral movement/stimulation group. In addition, higher muscle activation levels were found for the second session block as well as trial blocks 2 and 3. Overall, these findings indicated improved motor capabilities of the impaired muscles as evidenced by the higher voluntary EMG activation levels. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This article presents a novel evaluation system along with methods to evaluate bilateral coordination of arm function on activities of daily living tasks before and after robot-assisted therapy. An affordable bilateral assessment system (BiAS) consisting of two mini-passive measuring units modeled as three degree of freedom robots is described. The process for evaluating functional tasks using the BiAS is presented and we demonstrate its ability to measure wrist kinematic trajectories. Three metrics, phase difference, movement overlap, and task completion time, are used to evaluate the BiAS system on a bilateral symmetric (bi-drink) and a bilateral asymmetric (bi-pour) functional task. Wrist position and velocity trajectories are evaluated using these metrics to provide insight into temporal and spatial bilateral deficits after stroke. The BiAS system quantified movements of the wrists during functional tasks and detected differences in impaired and unimpaired arm movements. Case studies showed that stroke patients compared to healthy subjects move slower and are less likely to use their arm simultaneously even when the functional task requires simultaneous movement. After robot-assisted therapy, interlimb coordination spatial deficits moved toward normal coordination on functional tasks. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.},

A recent Cochrane Review, although based on a limited number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), showed that early robotic training of the upper limb (i.e., during acute or subacute phase) can enhance motor learning and improve functional abilities more than chronic-phase training. In this article, a new subacute-phase RCT with the Neuro-Rehabilitation-roBot (NeReBot) is presented. While in our first study we used the NeReBot in addition to conventional therapy, in this new trial we used the same device in substitution of standard proximal upper-limb rehabilitation. With this protocol, robot patients achieved similar reductions in motor impairment and enhancements in paretic upper-limb function to those gained by patients in a control group. By analyzing these results and those of previous studies, we hypothesize a new robotic protocol for acute and subacute stroke patients based on both treatment modalities (in addition and in substitution).},

abstract = {Highly impaired stroke patients at early stages of recovery are unable to generate enough muscle force to lift the weight of their own arm. Accordingly, task-related training is strongly limited or even impossible. However, as soon as partial or full arm weight support is provided, patients are enabled to perform arm rehabilitation training again throughout an increased workspace. In the literature, the current solutions for providing arm weight support are mostly mechanical. These systems have components that restrict the freedom of movement or entail additional disturbances. A scalable weight compensation for upper and lower arm that is online adjustable as well as generalizable to any robotic system is necessary. In this paper, a model-based feedforward weight compensation of upper and lower arm fulfilling these requirements is introduced. The proposed method is tested with the upper extremity rehabilitation robot ARMin V, but can be applied in any other actuated exoskeleton system. Experimental results were verified using EMG measurements. These results revealed that the proposed weight compensation reduces the effort of the subjects to 26{\%} on average and more importantly throughout the entire workspace of the robot.},

Mirror therapy is one of widely used methods for rehabilitation of impaired side movements because voluntary movement of the unimpaired side facilitates reorganizational changes in the motor cortex. The developed upper-limb exoskeleton was equipped with two brushless DC motors that helped generate three axes of upper-limb movements corresponding to other arm movements that were measured using inertial sensors. In this study, inertial sensors were used to estimate the joint angles for three target upper-limb movements: elbow flexion and extension (flex/ext), wrist flex/ext, and forearm pronation and supination (pro/sup). Elbow flex/ext was performed by the actuator that was directly attached to the elbow joint. The actuation of the forearm pro/sup and wrist flex/ext shared one motor using a developed cable-driven mechanism, and two types of motion were selectively performed. We assessed the feasibility of the proposed mirror-image device with the accuracy and precision of the motion estimation and the actuation of joint movements. An individual could perform most upper-limb movements for activities of daily living using the proposed device.},

Fourteen subjects with chronic stroke completed 2 weeks of 2.25 hours per session, 4 sessions per week of modBATRAC. Results. No significant changes were observed in UE Fugl-Meyer or Wolf Motor Function Test scores. Subjects did report increased paretic UE use on the Motor Activity Log (mean change, 0.50; SD = 0.70). Conclusions. The results of this study offer only partial support for the efficacy of modBATRAC. As in previous trials, modBATRAC facilitated increased use of the paretic arm, but unlike previous trials, it did not increase motor performance.

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of long-term neurological disability and the principle reason for seeking rehabilitative services in the US. Learning based rehabilitation training enables independent mobility in the majority of patients post stroke, however, restoration of fine manipulation, motor function and task specific functions of the hemiplegic arm and hand is noted in fewer than 15{\%} of the stroke patients. Brain plasticity is the innate mechanism enabling the recovery of motor skills through neurological reorganization of the brain as a response to limbs' manipulation. The objective of this research was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy for the upper limbs with a dual arm exoskeleton system (EXO-UL7) using three different modalities: bilateral mirror image with symmetric movements of both arms, unilateral movement of the affected arm and standard care. Five hemiparetic subjects were randomly assigned to each therapy modality. An upper limb exoskeleton was used to provide bilateral and unilateral treatments. Standard care was provided by a licensed physical therapist. Subjects were evaluated before and after the interventions using 13 different clinical measures. Following these treatments all of the subjects demonstrated significant improved of their fine motor control and gross control across all the treatment modalities. Subjects exhibited significant improvements in range of motion of the shoulder, and improved muscle strength for bilateral training and standard care, but not for unilateral training. In conclusion, a synergetic approach in which robotic treatments (unilateral and bilateral depending on the level of the motor control) are supplemented by the standard of care may maximize the outcome of the motor control recover following stroke. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Principles of motor control and learning such as bilateral coordination and task-specificity, are increasingly incorporated in the design of upper extremity rehabilitation protocols for stroke survivors. Yet most studies investigating the efficacy of new protocols report composite scores of standardized tests, such as the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity test (FM) and the Wolf Motor Arm Test, rather than determining how the motor control and coordination of arm movements has changed. Here we present a sub-study of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing a bilateral and unilateral training protocol where participants were assessed on bilateral and unilateral arm reaching. Eligible participants for the arm reaching analysis were 9 (FM = 37) and 9 (FM = 34) in Bilateral Arm Training with Rhythmic Auditory Cueing (BATRAC) and Dose Matched Therapeutic Exercises (DMTE), respectively. Participants undertook 18 sessions of training for 6 weeks with 20 min of active training per session. For bilateral arm reaching, participants after BATRAC were faster, with increased peak acceleration, fewer movement units, and smoother hand paths for each arm. The BATRAC training group showed greater improvements with training than the DMTE group during bilateral reaching for parameters of movement units and smoothness of hand path. For unilateral arm reaching, participants were faster after DMTE for paretic arm reaching; however, this group did not improve to a greater extent than the BATRAC training group. Within group functional gains were seen after BATRAC on FM, Wolf Motor Arm Test (time and weight) and after DMTE on FM and Wolf Weight. There was a positive correlation between movement units and the time component of the Wolf Motor Arm Test. The reaching analysis demonstrates task-specificity in training since BATRAC improves performance in bilateral reaching and DMTE improves performance in unilateral reaching. Temporal/spatial control outcomes in studies of post-stroke interventions can identify functionally relevant motor control changes that are not captured by traditional standardized tests. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Data from a clinical trial of 167 stroke patients assessed shortly after admission to the hospital and 5 weeks later provided information on clinical, motor, and functional outcomes measured using a neurologic status scale, a stroke severity scale, the Fugl-Meyer Scale, the Barthel Index, and the activities of daily living and cognition subscales of the Level of Rehabilitation Scale. Data were examined using Pearson correlation coefficients and power analyses. All measures were significantly correlated. There was also substantial congruency between the subscales of a measure and its total score. The measures had variable efficiencies; the Barthel Index was the most efficient and therefore required the fewest subjects to identify a significant effect. These data suggest that careful consideration must be given to the choice of stroke outcome measures in terms of their numbers, interrelationships, and statistical properties, as these factors have important implications for the design, analysis, and conduct of clinical stroke studies. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Heart Association, Inc.},

The primary outcome measure was Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) motor score, and the secondary outcomes were Wolf Motor Function Test-Functional Ability Scale (WMFT-FAS) and Barthel index (BI). The AA group, in comparison to the Control group, showed significantly greater increases in FMA-UE score (18.0 ± 9.4 versus 7.5 ± 5.5, p=0.002) and WMFT-FAS score (14.1 ± 7.9 versus 6.7 ± 7.8, p=0.025) after 3 weeks of treatment, whereas the increase in BI was not significant (21.2 ± 24.8 versus 13.1 ± 10.7, p=0.292). There were no adverse events. We conclude that arm training using the AA robotic device is safe and able to reduce motor deficits more effectively than matched conventional arm training in subacute phase of stroke. The study has been registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02729649.},

abstract = {Robot-assisted bilateral upper limb training typically requires two robotic devices that work cooperatively with a human user. The determination of appropriate movement trajectories is essential to avoid interference of the robotic systems and ensure an appropriate intersecting workspace with user limbs. This paper proposes a new three-stage trajectory generation method for bilateral upper limb training using interference analysis. These three stages include workspace analysis of robots and human hands, trajectory generation within the intersecting workspace, and interference analysis for training safety verification. This trajectory generation method is also implemented with subject-specific adaptation based on anthropometry of an individual. Experiments were conducted on seven healthy subjects with a variety of body sizes. All participants gave positive feedback on the suitability of the predefined training trajectories, and no robot interference was detected. This three-stage method provides guidelines for the standardization of robot-assisted bilateral upper limb training protocols. Future work will focus on proposing an adaptive trajectory generation algorithm with efficacy evaluation on a larger sample of subjects.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of and clinical tests on NeReBot (NEuroREhabilitation roBOT): a three degrees-of-freedom (DoF), wire-driven robot for poststroke upper-limb rehabilitation. Basically, the robot consists of a set of three wires independently driven by three electric motors. The wires are connected to the patient's upper limb by means of a splint and are supported by a transportable frame, located above the patient. By controlling wire length, rehabilitation treatment (based on the passive or active-assistive spatial motion of the limb) can be delivered over a wide working space. The arm trajectory is set by the therapist through a very simple teaching-by-showing procedure, enabling most common "hands on" therapy exercises to be reproduced by the robot. Compared to other rehabilitation robots, NeReBot offers the advantages of a low-cost mechanical structure, intrinsically safe treatment thanks to the use of wires, high acceptability by the patient, who does not feel constrained by an "industrial-like" robot, transportability (it can be easily placed aside a hospital bed and/or a wheelchair), and a good trade-off between low number of DoF and spatial performance. These features and the very encouraging results of the first clinical trials make the NeReBot a good candidate for adoption in the rehabilitation treatment of subacute stroke survivors. Clinical trials were performed with a 12-patient experimental group and a 12-patient control group. Resulted that the patients who received robotic therapy in addition to conventional therapy showed greater reductions in motor impairment (in terms of Medical Research Council score, the upper limb subsection of the Fugl-Meyer score, and the Motor Status Score) and improvements in functional abilities (as measured by the Functional Independence Measure and its motor component). No adverse effects occurred and the robotic approach was very well accepted. According to these results, the NeReBot therapy may efficaciously complement standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation and offer novel therapeutic strategies for neurological rehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The hand is an organ of grasping as well as sensation, communication , and fine dexterity. Since the 80's, many researchers have been attempting to develop robotic devices aiming at replicat-ing the functions of the human hand in the fields of industrial robotics, tele-manipulation, humanoid robotics, and upper limb prosthetics. A special kind of robotic hand is the hand exoskel-eton, that is directly attached to the human hand with the aim of providing assistance in motion/power generation. Hand exoskel-etons are increasingly widespread in robot-based rehabilitation of patients suffering from different pathologies (in particular neurological diseases). This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of hand exoskeletons developed for rehabilitation purposes and proposes a new systematic classification according to three key points related to the kinematic architecture: (i) mobility of a single finger exoskeleton, (ii) number of physical connections between the exoskeleton and the human finger phalanges, and (iii) way of integration of the exoskeleton mechanism with the human parts. The discussion based upon the classification can be helpful to understand the reasons of adopting certain solutions for specific applications and the advantages and drawbacks of different designs, based on the work already done by other researchers. The final purpose of the proposed classification is then to provide guidelines useful for the design of new hand exo-skeletons on the basis of a systematic analysis. As an example, the solution designed, manufactured and clinically tested by the authors is reported.},

abstract = {For stroke survivors and many other people with upper-extremity impairment, daily life can be difficult without properly functioning arms. Some modern physical therapy exercises focus on rehabilitating people with these troubles by correcting patients' perceptions of their own body to eventually regain complete control and strength over their arms again. Augmentative wearable robots, such as the upper-extremity exoskeletons and exosuits, may be able to assist in this endeavor. A common drawback in many of these exoskeletons, however, is their inability to conform to the natural flexibility of the human body without a rigid base. We have built one such exosuit to address this challenge: Compliant Robotic Upper-extremity eXosuit (CRUX). This robot is a compliant, lightweight, multi-DoF, portable exosuit that affords its wearer the ability to augment themselves in many unconventional settings (i.e. outside of a clinic). These attributes are largely achieved by using a modified tensegrity design situated according to measured lines of minimal-extension, where a network of tension members provide a foundation to apply augmentative forces via precisely placed power-lines. In this paper, we detail the design process of CRUX, the report on CRUX's prototypical composition, and describe the mimetic control algorithm used. We also discuss the results of three studies that illustrate the efficacy of CRUX's mimetic controller, CRUX's flexibility and compliance, and the metabolic cost reduction when users exercise with assistance from CRUX as opposed to without. We conclude this paper with a summary of our findings, potential use cases for this technology, and the direction of future related work.},

abstract = {Most activities in daily life involve the use of both hands. Post-stroke patients lose inter-limb coordination and require intensive rehabilitation therapy for a faster recovery. Robot based rehabilitation is preferred to traditional rehabilitation methods due to precise repeatability and the accurate measurements it provides. Bimanual rehabilitation robots can help the patient to keep the position symmetry. Most studies in rehabilitation robots have overlooked the necessity of accurate resistance training. Conventional rehabilitation methods cannot ensure position synchronization during rehabilitation. In order to realize resistance training with maximum efficiency, the resistance should be varied with a reference to a strength profile of a healthy person. This paper presents a master slave robot system designed for bimanual rehabilitation training. Disturbance OBservers (DOB) are implemented to make the system robust. Accurate force sensing is achieved using the Reaction Torque OBserver (RTOB). The paper also presents a method for seamless transfer between the resistance and assistance modes. The proposed methods were validated by experiments.},

abstract = {Objective: To carry out a preliminary feasibility study of a new concept of robot therapy for severely impaired patients after stroke. Design: A haptic manipulandum connected to a bar that can rotate freely while providing a measure of the rotation angle. The controller combines a bilateral reaching task with the task of balancing the action of the 2 arms. Reinforcement is given to the subject in 2 forms: audio-visual and haptic by means of adaptable force fields. Patients: Four highly paretic patients with chronic stroke (Fugl-Meyer score less than 15). Methods: The training cycle consisted of 5 sessions over a period of 2 weeks. Each session (45 min) was divided in blocks of 10 pairs of forward/backward movements. Performance was determined by evaluating the number of successful movements per session, the session-by-session decrease in the assistive field, the mean reaching time, and the mean stopping field. Results: All subjects could understand the task, appreciated it and improved their performance during training. The reaching movements became smoother and quicker; balance errors and the magnitude of the resisting field were consistently reduced. Conclusion: Bilateral robot therapy is a promising technique, provided that it self-adapts to the patient's performance. Formal clinical trials should address this point. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.},

abstract = {Transfer learning, or inductive transfer, refers to the transfer of knowledge from a source task to a target task. In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning can be implemented by transplanting the learned feature layers from one CNN (derived from the source task) to initialize another (for the target task). Previous research has shown that the choice of the source CNN impacts the performance of the target task. In the current literature, there is no principled way for selecting a source CNN for a given target task despite the increasing availability of pre-trained source CNNs. In this paper we investigate the possibility of automatically ranking source CNNs prior to utilizing them for a target task. In particular, we present an information theoretic framework to understand the source-target relationship and use this as a basis to derive an approach to automatically rank source CNNs in an efficient, zero-shot manner. The practical utility of the approach is thoroughly evaluated using the Places-MIT dataset, MNIST dataset and a real-world MRI database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ranking method for transfer learning.},

abstract = {After stroke, the function of primary motor cortex (M1) between the hemispheres may become unbalanced. Techniques that promote a re-balancing of M1 excitability may prime the brain to be more responsive to rehabilitation therapies and lead to improved functional outcomes. The present study examined the effects of Active-Passive Bilateral Therapy (APBT), a putative movement-based priming strategy designed to reduce intracortical inhibition and increase excitability within the ipsilesional M1. Thirty-two patients with upper limb weakness at least 6 months after stroke were randomized to a 1-month intervention of self-directed motor practice with their affected upper limb (control group) or to APBT for 10-15 min prior to the same motor practice (APBT group). A blinded clinical rater assessed upper limb function at baseline, and immediately and 1 month after the intervention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess M1 excitability. Immediately after the intervention, motor function of the affected upper limb improved in both groups (P {\textless} 0.005). One month after the intervention, the APBT group had better upper limb motor function than control patients (P {\textless} 0.05). The APBT group had increased ipsilesional M1 excitability (P {\textless} 0.025), increased transcallosal inhibition from ipsilesional to contralesional M1 (P {\textless} 0.01) and increased intracortical inhibition within contralesional M1 (P {\textless} 0.005). None of these changes were found in the control group. APBT produced sustained improvements in upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients and induced specific and sustained changes in motor cortex inhibitory function. We speculate that APBT may have facilitated plastic reorganization in the brain in response to motor therapy. The utility of APBT as an adjuvant to physical therapy warrants further consideration. {\textcopyright} The Author (2008). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.

Literature and experience show that, due to the nature of FSR construction, its time dependency makes it hard to calibrate at first glance by simple measurements. The methodology employed is based upon the comparison of the measured data obtained from a FSR with the one obtained from a calibrated load cell. The force loading and unloading processes are performed automatically with a mechatronic device which allows having time invariant and variant force profiles. Special analysis is taken over creep and hysteresis compensation along with its relation with static and dynamic applications with the help of existing literature. At the end a time dependant function is obtained that relates the force applied on the sensor, and the signal obtained from it, allowing for the use on applications to measure force and pressure in ranges from 0 to 20N and 0 to 100mmHg respectively. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

Design: A single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: Four hospitals. Participants: Outpatients with chronic stroke and mild to moderate motor impairment (N=44). Intervention: UHT combined unilateral RT (URT) and modified constraint-induced therapy. BHT combined bilateral RT (BRT) and bilateral arm training. The RT group received URT and BRT. The intervention frequency for the 3 groups was 90 min/d 3 d/wk for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA, divided into the proximal and distal subscale) and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) version 3.0 scores before, immediately after, and 3 months after treatment and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) scale scores before and immediately after treatment. Results: The results favored BHT over UHT on the FMA total score and distal score at the posttest (P=.03 and .04) and follow-up (P=.01 and .047) assessment and BHT over RT on the follow-up FMA distal scores (P=.03). At the posttest assessment, the WMFT and SIS scores of the 3 groups improved significantly without between-group differences, and the RT group showed significantly greater improvement in the mobility domain of NEADL compared with the BHT group (P{\textless}.01). Conclusions: BHT was more effective for improving upper extremity motor function, particularly distal motor function at follow-up, and individuals in the RT group demonstrated improved functional ambulation post intervention.},

Visual field recovery was compared with the retrospective data of 7 controls, whose defect sizes and age of lesions were matched to those of the experimental subjects and who had received standard rehabilitation with compensatory eye movement and exploration training. Results All 7 patients in the treatment group completed the treatment protocol. The safety and acceptance were excellent, and patients reported occasional skin itching beneath the electrodes as the only minor side effect. Irrespective of their treatment, both groups (treatment and control) showed improved visual fields as documented by an increased mean sensitivity threshold in decibels in standard static perimetry. Recovery was significantly greater (P {\textless}.05) in the tDCS/VRT patients (36.73{\%} ± 37.0{\%}) than in the controls (10.74{\%} ± 8.86{\%}). Conclusion In this open-label pilot study, tDCS/VRT in subacute stroke was demonstrated to be safe, with excellent applicability and acceptance of the treatment. Preliminary effectiveness calculations show that tDCS/VRT may be superior to standard vision training procedures. A confirmatory, larger-sample, controlled, randomized, and double-blind trial is now underway to compare real-tDCS− versus sham-tDCS−supported visual field training in the early vision rehabilitation phase.

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2004;85:1076-83. Objectives To characterize fine motor control through finger tapping in both arms of 10 patients with chronic stroke, to make baseline comparisons with matched controls, and to examine the responsiveness of deficits seen in stroke patients after 6 weeks of bilateral arm-based training. Design Nonrandomized controlled, cohort before-after trial. Setting Research institution. Participants Ten people from the community with chronic unilateral ischemic stroke and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants with hemiparesis had completed all conventional care and were more than 6 month poststroke. Inclusion criteria were at least 6 months since a unilateral stroke, ability to follow simple instructions and 2-step commands, volitional control of the nonparetic arm, and at least minimal antigravity movement in the shoulder of the paretic arm. Interventions Not applicable. Main outcome measures Measurements included rate and timing consistency of unilateral tapping at a preferred and a maximal rate and the accuracy and stability of interlimb coordination in bilateral simultaneous (inphase) and alternating (antiphase) tapping at a preferred rate. Results Nonparetic finger control was similar to that of the nondisabled participants except under bilateral conditions, where it was less consistent. A subgroup with residual paretic finger function, had slower and less consistent paretic finger tapping, as well as less accurate and more variable interlimb coordination; however, basic bilateral coupling relationships were preserved. Bilateral arm-based training improved bilateral nonparetic consistency but slowed unilateral preferred tapping. Training also improved paretic fine motor control in 2 of 4 participants with mild stroke severity. The 2 responders, with dominant hemisphere lesions, indicated a possible recovery advantage with bilateral training for such lesions. Conclusions In general, nonparetic finger control for tapping was preserved but paretic finger control was compromised. Disruption of nonparetic control of tapping, particularly consistency of tapping, occurred during bilateral tapping tasks but was responsive to 6 weeks of bilateral arm-based training. Despite the apparent lack of training specificity, the generalizable effects of bilateral arm training to fine motor interlimb coordination may reflect central motor control mechanisms for upper-extremity coordination, which may be accessed and may influence the recovery of arm function after stroke. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

The robotic compliance regulation was achieved by modifying predefined training trajectories in real time, based on measured human–robot interaction force and human users' position within subject-specific workspace. Experimental data were collected from healthy subjects, and indicate that human users can follow predefined training trajectories well under real-time compliance variation, with the maximum normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) value no greater than 1.44{\%}. Preliminary findings are encouraging, which demonstrates the availability of the proposed subject-specific compliance adaptation strategy, and the potential with enhanced training safety and efficacy.

Forty-eight stroke studies were selected from three databases with 25 comparisons qualifying for inclusion in our meta-analysis. We identified and coded four types of bilateral arm interventions with 366 stroke patients. A random effects model using the standardized mean difference technique determined a large and significant effect size (0.734; SE=0.125), high fail-safe N (532), and medium variability in the studies (I2=63{\%}). Moderator variable analysis on the type of bilateral training revealed two large and significant effects: (a) BATRAC (0.842; SE=0.155) and (b) coupled bilateral and EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation (1.142; SE=0.176). These novel findings provide strong evidence supporting bilateral arm training with the caveat that two coupled protocols, rhythmic alternating movements and active stimulation, are most effective. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Sharifi2020,
abstract = {In this paper, a new impedance-based teleoperation strategy is proposed for assist-as-needed tele-rehabilitation via a multi-DOF telerobotic system having patient–master and therapist–slave interactions. Unlike a regular teleoperation system and as the main contribution of this work to minimize the therapist's movements, the therapist's hand only follows the patient's deviation from the target trajectory. Also it provides a better perception of the patient's problems in motor control to the therapist The admissible deviation of the patient's limb from a reference target trajectory is governed by an impedance model responding to both patient's and therapist's interaction forces. As the other benefit of this framework, two sources of assistance to the patient are delivered through the master robot: (1) the adjustable impedance model, and (2) the force applied by the therapist to the slave robot. The assistive impedance model is beneficial to reduce magnitudes of the required force from the therapist and decrease his/her intervention. This results in delaying and declining the therapist's muscle fatigue in time-consuming movement therapies. Bilateral nonlinear control laws with two types of adaptation laws are designed for the nonlinear teleoperation system. The Lyapunov stability proof of the teleoperation system and the stability of the impedance model enhance the patient's and therapist's safety even in the presence of modeling uncertainties of the multi-DOF telerobotic system. The performance of the proposed bilateral impedance-based strategy is experimentally investigated using different impedance parameters adjusted based on the patient's characteristics (e.g., involuntary tremor) and disabilities (e.g., insufficient actuation force). The experiments are performed by a healthy person (as the therapist), a mechanical test bed and a volunteer (simulating the patients' characteristics). A new force–position mapping from Cartesian to Normal–Tangential (N–T) coordinates is utilized between the master and slave workspaces and compared with typical Cartesian to Cartesian projection.},

Objective: To investigate whether early therapy with a novel robotic device can reduce motor impairment and enhance functional recovery of poststroke patients with hemiparetic and hemiplegic upper limb. Design: A single-blind randomized controlled trial, with an 8-month follow-up. Setting: Neurologic department and rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Thirty-five patients with acute (≤1wk of onset), unilateral, ischemic embolic, or thrombotic stroke. Interventions: Patients of both groups received the same dose and length per day of standard poststroke multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The experimental group (n=17) received additional early sensorimotor robotic training, 4 hours a week for 5 weeks; the control group (n=18) was exposed to the robotic device, 30 minutes a week, twice a week, but the exercises were performed with the unimpaired upper limb. Training by robot consisted of peripheral manipulation of the shoulder and elbow of the impaired limb, correlated with visual stimuli. Main Outcome Measures: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of upper-extremity function (shoulder/elbow and coordination and wrist/hand subsections) to measure each trained limb segment; the Medical Research Council (MRC) score to measure the strength of muscle force during 3 actions: shoulder abduction (MRC deltoid), elbow flexion (MRC biceps), and wrist flexion (MRC wrist flexors); the FIM instrument and its motor component; and the Trunk Control Test (TCT) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Results: Compared with the patients in the control group, the experimental group showed significant gains in motor impairment and functional recovery of the upper limb after robot therapy, as measured by the MRC deltoid (P≤.05) and biceps (P{\textless}.05) scores, the FMA for the proximal upper arm (P{\textless}.05), the FIM instrument (P{\textless}.05), and the FIM motor score (P{\textless}.01); these gains were also sustained at the 3- and 8-month follow-up. The FMA and MRC wrist flexor test findings did not differ statistically either at the end of training or at the follow-up sessions. We found no significant differences in MAS and TCT in either group in any of the evaluations. No adverse effects occurred and the robotic approach was very well accepted. Conclusions: Patients who received robotic therapy in addition to conventional therapy showed greater reductions in motor impairment and improvements in functional abilities. Robotic therapy may therefore effectively complement standard rehabilitation from the start, by providing therapeutic support for patients with poststroke plegic and paretic upper limb. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Rehabilitation robots are increasingly being tested and promoted for clinical neurorehabilitation. Compared with conventional and manual methods, robots allow for a variety of advantages, particularly in the areas of interventional control and the ability to provide a high volume of facilitated movement. Since 1997, there have been more than 60 clinical trials reporting the use of two dozen different robots for neurorehabilitation. Although there are a number of smaller pilot studies, there are only few larger clinical trials. There may be a number of reasons why pilot robot studies do not materialize into larger studies. Beyond devices that failed to perform as intended, what are the clinical design issues that have limited these studies? Some basic considerations include randomization, inclusion of a control group, power calculation based on a clinically meaningful outcome, and finally, reproducible descriptions of the intervention being tested. Although many of these issues are general challenges presented for all rehabilitation studies, there are clinical design features that would likely greatly improve interpretation of results and better position robot devices toward the next clinical trial step. On the other hand, the absence of these elements, even in the setting of a pilot study, may significantly hamper the interpretation of results and not yield sufficient information on treatment effects, adverse event rates, dropout rate, and so on, to allow further testing to proceed to follow-up Food and Drug Administration phase II and III studies. Development of rehabilitation robots for clinical use needs to occur hand in hand with well-conducted clinical trials to provide evidence of efficacy while also taking into account costs.

We enrolled 23 subjects who were allocated to 2 groups: RAT + real tDCS and RAT + sham-tDCS. Each patient underwent 10 sessions (5 sessions/week) over two weeks. Outcome measures were collected before and after treatment: (i) Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), (ii) Box and Block Test (BBT), and (iii) Motor Activity Log (MAL). Results. Both groups reported a significant improvement in FMA-UE score after treatment (p {\textless} 0.01). No significant between-groups differences were found in motor function. However, when the analysis was adjusted for stroke type and duration, a significant interaction effect (p {\textless} 0.05) was detected, showing that stroke duration (acute versus chronic) and type (cortical versus subcortical) modify the effect of tDCS and robotics on motor function. Patients with chronic and subcortical stroke benefited more from the treatments than patients with acute and cortical stroke, who presented very small changes. Conclusion. The additional use of bilateral tDCS to RAT seems to have a significant beneficial effect depending on the duration and type of stroke. These results should be verified by additional confirmatory studies.},

abstract = {According to the neuro-rehabilitation theory, compared with unilateral training, bilateral training is proven to be an effective method for hemiparesis, which affects the most part of stroke patients. In this study, a novel bilateral rehabilitation training system, which incorporates a lightweight exoskeleton device worn on the affected limb; a haptic device (Phantom Premium), which is used for generating a desired tactile feedback for the affected limb; and a VR (virtual reality) graphic interface, has been developed. The use of VR technology during rehabilitation can provide goal directed tasks with rewards and motivate the patient to undertake extended rehabilitation. This paper is mainly focused on elbow joint training, and other independent joints can be trained by easily changing the VR training interface. The haptic device is adopted to enable patients to use their own decision making abilities with a tactical feedback. Integrated with a VR-based graphic interface, the goal-oriented task can help to gradually recovery their motor function with a coordinative motion between two limbs. In particular, the proposed system can accelerate neural plasticity and motor recovery in those patients with little muscle strength by using the exoskeleton device. The exoskeleton device can provide from relatively high joint impedance to near-zero impedance, and can provide a partial assist as the patient requires.},

Design: Single-cohort, pre- and postretention design. Setting: Rehabilitation department at a medical university. Participants: Twenty subjects who had unilateral strokes at least 6 months before enrolling in the study. Intervention: A training program (40min/session, 3 sessions/wk for 8wk) consisting of 10 minutes of conventional rehabilitation and 30 minutes of robot-aided, bilateral force-induced, isokinetic arm movement training to improve paretic upper-limb motor function. Main Outcome Measures: The interval of pretest, post-test, and retention test was set at 8 weeks. Clinical arm motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA], upper-limb motor function, Frenchay Arm Test, Modified Ashworth Scale), paretic upper-limb strength (grip strength, arm push and pull strength), and reaching kinematics analysis (peak velocity, percentage of time to peak velocity, movement time, normalized jerk score) were used as outcome measures. Results: After comparing the sets of scores, we found that the post-test and retention test in arm motor function significantly improved in terms of grip (P=.009), push (P=.001), and pull (P=.001) strengths, and FMA upper-limb scale (P{\textless}.001). Reaching kinematics significantly improved in terms of movement time (P=.015), peak velocity (P=.035), percentage of time to peak velocity (P=.004), and normalized jerk score (P=.008). Improvement in reaching ability was not sustained in the retention test. Conclusions: Preliminary results showed that conventional rehabilitation combined with robot-aided, bilateral force-induced, isokinetic arm training might enhance the recovery of strength and motor control ability in the paretic upper limb of patients with chronic stroke. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the effects of robot-assisted movement training with conventional techniques for the rehabilitation of upper-limb motor function after stroke. Design: Randomized controlled trial, 6-month follow-up. Setting: A Department of Veterans Affairs rehabilitation research and development center. Participants: Consecutive sample of 27 subjects with chronic hemiparesis ({\textgreater}6mo after cerebrovascular accident) randomly allocated to group. Interventions: All subjects received twenty-four 1-hour sessions over 2 months. Subjects in the robot group practiced shoulder and elbow movements while assisted by a robot manipulator. Subjects in the control group received neurodevelopmental therapy (targeting proximal upper limb function) and 5 minutes of exposure to the robot in each session. Main Outcome Measures: Fugl-Meyer assessment of motor impairment, FIM™ instrument, and biomechanic measures of strength and reaching kinematics. Clinical evaluations were performed by a therapist blinded to group assignments. Results: Compared with the control group, the robot group had larger improvements in the proximal movement portion of the Fugl-Meyer test after 1 month of treatment (P{\textless}.05) and also after 2 months of treatment (P{\textless}.05). The robot group had larger gains in strength (P{\textless}.02) and larger increases in reach extent (P{\textless}.01) after 2 months of treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, the groups no longer differed in terms of the Fugl-Meyer test (P{\textgreater}.30); however, the robot group had larger improvements in the FIM (P{\textless}.04). Conclusions: Compared with conventional treatment, robot- assisted movements had advantages in terms of clinical and biomechanical measures. Further research into the use of robotic manipulation for motor rehabilitation is justified. {\textcopyright} 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {A low cost robotic-assisted prototype for finger and hand rehabilitation of people affected by a stroke is presented. The system was developed by a team of undergraduate students led by a Design lecturer in collaboration with the Rehabilitation Unit of the Pe{\~{n}}ablanca Public Hospital in Chile. The system consists of a flexion sensor equipped glove, a hand exoskeleton and an Arduino control unit. The patient wears the glove in his healthy hand. When s/he performs movements with the healthy hand, the sensors register the flexion of the fingers and send this information to the servo motors installed in an exoskeleton attached to the affected hand. In this way, the affected hand reproduces the movement of the healthy hand. The system uses a combination of the mirror therapy (the patient sees his/her affected hand moving in the same way that the healthy hand does) and passive exercising (as the exoskeleton produces the movement of the hand affected by the stroke). The combination of two types of therapy in a single low cost system makes the present work unique. In the near future, the developed prototype will be used to validate the effectiveness of the new proposed robotic therapy.},

abstract = {Study Design: An iterative design process was used to obtain design parameters that satisfy both kinematic and dynamic requirements for the hand exoskeleton. This design was validated through experimental studies. Introduction: The success of hand rehabilitation after impairments depends on the timing, intensity, repetition, and frequency, as well as task-specific training. Considering the continuing constraints placed on therapist-led rehabilitation and need for better outcomes, robot-assisted rehabilitation has been explored. Soft robotic approaches have been implemented for a hand rehabilitation exoskeleton as they have more tolerance for alignment with biological joints than those of hard exoskeletons. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study was to design, develop, and validate a soft robotic exoskeleton for hand rehabilitation. Methods: A motion capture system validated the kinematics of the soft robotic digit attached on top of a human index finger. A pneumatic control system and algorithms were developed to operate the exoskeleton based on three therapeutic modes: continuous passive, active assistive, and active resistive motion. Pilot studies were carried out on one healthy and one poststroke participant using continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy modes. Results: The soft robotic digits were able to produce required range of motion and accommodate for dorsal lengthening, with trajectories of the center of rotation of the soft robotic joints in close agreement with the center of rotation of the human finger joints. Discussion: The exoskeleton showed the robust performance of the robot in applying continuous passive motion and bilateral/bimanual therapy. Conclusions: This soft robotic exoskeleton is promising for assisting in the rehabilitation of the hand.},

@article{Young2005,
abstract = {Background and Purpose - Acute stroke trials typically use disability scales as their primary end point. Neurologic impairment scales such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) are possibly more sensitive to change in patient status. We aimed to compare a range of potential NIHSS end points with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) end points. Methods - We simulated a total of 6000 clinical trials, each with 1400 patients. We estimated statistical power for a range of NIHSS end points, including prognosis-adjusted and fixed dichotomized end points. These end points were compared with the BI and mRS dichotomized at 95 and 1, respectively. Results - The most powerful fixed end point was the NIHSS dichotomized at 1. For prognosis-adjusted outcome, we found greatest power if we defined success as achieving a score of ≤1 or improvement by at least 11 points from baseline. We are more likely to achieve a statistically significant result by using this prognosis-adjusted end point instead of NIHSS ≤1 (odds ratio, 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 2.5 to 3.2). Use of the optimal NIHSS prognosis-adjusted end point rather than BI ≥95 could justify a reduction in sample size of approximately 68{\%} (95{\%} CI, 67{\%} to 69{\%}) without loss of statistical power. Conclusions - The NIHSS neurologic scale appears more sensitive than the BI or mRS, allowing smaller sample sizes or greater statistical power. The use of an NIHSS prognosis-adjusted end point could allow therapeutic effects from drugs to be more easily identified. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {Purpose of review: Neural plasticity represents a crucial mechanism of the human brain to adapt to environmental changes in the developing and adult human central nervous system. This property of the central nervous system contributes to learning and functional recovery from neurological diseases such as stroke. Novel interventional approaches have been proposed and are under investigation to modulate neural plasticity, enhance it when it plays an adaptive role and downregulate it when it is considered maladaptive. Recent findings: One of the purposes of research in neurorehabilitation has been to develop interventional approaches to enhance the beneficial effects of training. Procedures like cortical stimulation, administration of central nervous system active drugs and modulation of afferent input have been evaluated as drivers of neural plasticity in healthy subjects and in small groups of patients with stroke. So far, these studies have shown promising results and translation into the clinic is under investigation. Summary: Cortical stimulation and purposeful changes in afferent input that modulate neural plasticity impact on behavioral markers of performance, learning and functional recovery and represent promising tools in neurorehabilitation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Background: Arm hemiparesis secondary to stroke is common and disabling. We aimed to assess whether robotic training of an affected arm with ARMin-an exoskeleton robot that allows task-specific training in three dimensions-reduces motor impairment more effectively than does conventional therapy. Methods: In a prospective, multicentre, parallel-group randomised trial, we enrolled patients who had had motor impairment for more than 6 months and moderate-to-severe arm paresis after a cerebrovascular accident who met our eligibility criteria from four centres in Switzerland. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive robotic or conventional therapy using a centre-stratified randomisation procedure. For both groups, therapy was given for at least 45 min three times a week for 8 weeks (total 24 sessions). The primary outcome was change in score on the arm (upper extremity) section of the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA-UE). Assessors tested patients immediately before therapy, after 4 weeks of therapy, at the end of therapy, and 16 weeks and 34 weeks after start of therapy. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation, but patients, therapists, and data analysts were unmasked. Analyses were by modified intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00719433. Findings: Between May 4, 2009, and Sept 3, 2012, 143 individuals were tested for eligibility, of whom 77 were eligible and agreed to participate. 38 patients assigned to robotic therapy and 35 assigned to conventional therapy were included in analyses. Patients assigned to robotic therapy had significantly greater improvements in motor function in the affected arm over the course of the study as measured by FMA-UE than did those assigned to conventional therapy (F=4{\textperiodcentered}1, p=0{\textperiodcentered}041; mean difference in score 0{\textperiodcentered}78 points, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}03-1{\textperiodcentered}53). No serious adverse events related to the study occurred. Interpretation: Neurorehabilitation therapy including task-oriented training with an exoskeleton robot can enhance improvement of motor function in a chronically impaired paretic arm after stroke more effectively than conventional therapy. However, the absolute difference between effects of robotic and conventional therapy in our study was small and of weak significance, which leaves the clinical relevance in question.

abstract = {Context: Reorganization in central motor networks occurs during early recovery from hemiparetic stroke. In chronic stroke survivors, specific rehabilitation therapy can improve upper extremity function. Objective: To test the hypothesis that in patients who have chronic motor impairment following stroke, specific rehabilitation therapy that improves arm function is associated with reorganization of cortical networks. Design, Setting, and Patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in a US ambulatory rehabilitation program with 21 patients (median [IQR], 50.3 [34.8-77.3] months after unilateral stroke). Data were collected between 2001 and 2004. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) (n=9) or standardized dose-matched therapeutic exercises (DMTE) (n=12). Both were conducted for 1 hour, 3 times a week, for 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Within 2 weeks before and after the intervention, brain activation during elbow movement assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and functional outcome assessed using arm function scores. Results: Patients in the BATRAC group but not in the DMTE group increased hemispheric activation during paretic arm movement (P = .03). Changes in activation were observed in the contralesional cerebrum and ipsilesional cerebellum (P=.009). BATRAC was associated with significant increases in activation in precentral (P{\textless}.001) and postcentral gyri (P=.03) and the cerebellum (P{\textless}.001), although 3 BATRAC patients showed no fMRI changes. Considering all patients, there were no differences in functional outcome between groups. When only BATRAC patients with fMRI response were included (n=6), BATRAC improved arm function more than DMTE did (P=.02). Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that BATRAC induces reorganization in contralesional motor networks and provide biological plausibility for repetitive bilateral training as a potential therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in hemiparetic stroke.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to design and experiment a hand rehabilitation device for domestic intensive and repetitive training for subjects affected by hemiparesis, assuring their active participation during the exercise. The designed system is composed by the Gloreha hand rehabilitation glove along with its controller PC, and a device for electromyographic signals recording. To assure user's volitional involvement during the rehabilitation session, residual volitional EMG is used to trigger the onset of a predetermined hand movement sequence applied in an open-loop modality. In particular, a target hand movement for the rehabilitation session is defined (i.e., grasping, pitching, etc.), and the patient is required to start the movement. Only when the muscular activity overcomes a predefined threshold, Gloreha supports the patient-initiated movement. The designed controller has been tested on a group of healthy volunteers, and on three neurological patients, with different residual ability. All the users were able to calibrate and correctly use the system, and they reported that the system was more challenging to be used with respect to the standard Gloreha-based rehabilitation session, and required more attention and involvement. The results obtained during the preliminary tests are encouraging, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Background. No rehabilitation intervention has effectively improved functional use of the arm and hand in patients with severe upper limb paresis after stroke. Pilot studies suggest the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation and bilateral robotic training to enhance gains. Objective. In a double-blind, randomized trial the combination of these interventions was tested. Methods. This study randomized 96 patients with an ischemic supratentorial lesion of 3 to 8 weeks' duration with severe impairment of motor control with a Fugl-Meyer score (FMS) for the upper limb {\textless}18 into 3 groups. For 6 weeks, group A received anodal stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere, group B received cathodal stimulation of the nonlesioned side for 20 minutes at 2.0 mA, and group C received sham stimulation. The electrodes were placed over the hand area and above the contralateral orbit. Contemporaneously, the subjects practiced 400 repetitions each of 2 different bilateral movements on a robotic assistive device. Results. The groups were matched at onset. The FMS improved in all patients at 6 weeks (P {\textless}.001). No between-group differences were found; initial versus finish FMS scores were 7.8 ± 3.8 versus 19.1 ± 14.4 in group A, 7.9 ± 3.4 versus 18.8 ± 10.5 in group B, and 8.2 ± 4.4 versus 19.2 ± 15.0 in group C. No significant changes between groups were present at 3 months. Conclusions. Neither anodal nor cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhanced the effect of bilateral arm training in this exploratory trial of patients with cortical involvement and severe weakness. Unilateral hand training and upregulation of the nonlesioned hemisphere might also be tried in this population. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Neurorehabilitation.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the treatment effects of bilateral robotic priming combined with the task-oriented approach on motor impairment, disability, daily function, and quality of life in patients with subacute stroke. Design: A randomized controlled trial. Setting: Occupational therapy clinics in medical centers. Subjects: Thirty-one subacute stroke patients were recruited. Interventions: Participants were randomly assigned to receive bilateral priming combined with the task-oriented approach (i.e., primed group) or to the task-oriented approach alone (i.e., unprimed group) for 90 minutes/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. The primed group began with the bilateral priming technique by using a bimanual robot-aided device. Main measures: Motor impairments were assessed by the Fugal-Meyer Assessment, grip strength, and the Box and Block Test. Disability and daily function were measured by the modified Rankin Scale, the Functional Independence Measure, and actigraphy. Quality of life was examined by the Stroke Impact Scale. Results: The primed and unprimed groups improved significantly on most outcomes over time. The primed group demonstrated significantly better improvement on the Stroke Impact Scale strength subscale (p = 0.012) and a trend for greater improvement on the modified Rankin Scale (p = 0.065) than the unprimed group. Conclusion: Bilateral priming combined with the task-oriented approach elicited more improvements in self-reported strength and disability degrees than the task-oriented approach by itself. Further large-scale research with at least 31 participants in each intervention group is suggested to confirm the study findings.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is to promote use of a limb that is functionally impaired after a stroke. In one form of CIMT to treat upper limb impairment, use of the less severely affected arm is restricted for many hours each weekday over 2 consecutive weeks. The EXCITE trial has previously shown the efficacy of this intervention for patients 3-9 months poststroke who were followed-up for the next 12 months. We assessed the retention of improvements 24 months after the intervention. Methods: In the EXCITE trial, 106 of 222 participants who had mild to moderate poststroke impairments were randomly assigned to receive CIMT rather than usual and customary care. We assessed this group of patients every 4 months for the primary outcome measure of impaired upper limb function, as measured with the Wolf motor function test (WMFT) and the motor activity log (MAL). Health-related quality of life, measured with the stroke impact scale (SIS), was a secondary outcome measure. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00057018. Findings: The effects at 24 months after treatment did not decline from those at 12 months for time taken to complete the WMFT (-0{\textperiodcentered}32 s, 95{\%} CI -3{\textperiodcentered}70 to 3{\textperiodcentered}06), for weight lifted in the WMFT (-1{\textperiodcentered}39 kg, -2{\textperiodcentered}74 to -0{\textperiodcentered}04), for WMFT grip strength (-4{\textperiodcentered}39 kg, -6{\textperiodcentered}91 to -1{\textperiodcentered}86), for amount of use in the MAL (-0{\textperiodcentered}17, -0{\textperiodcentered}38 to 0{\textperiodcentered}04), or for how well the limb was used in the MAL (-0{\textperiodcentered}14, -0{\textperiodcentered}34 to 0{\textperiodcentered}06). The additional changes were in the direction of increased therapeutic effect. For the strength components of the WMFT, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001. Interpretation: Patients who have mild to moderate impairments 3-9 months poststroke have substantial improvement in functional use of the paretic upper limb and quality of life 2 years after a 2-week CIMT intervention. Thus, this intervention has persistent benefits. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Simkins2016a,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the physiotherapeutic benefits of bilateral symmetric training (BST) for stroke survivors affected by hemiparesis. Design/methodology/approach – Other studies have investigated symmetric physiotherapy. A key difficulty in previous work is in maintaining mirror-imaged trajectories between the affected and less-affected limbs. This obstacle was overcome in this work by using a two-armed robotic exoskeleton to enforce symmetry. In total, 15 subjects, {\textgreater}6 months post stroke were, randomly assigned to bilateral symmetric robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and standard physical therapy. Findings – After 12 training sessions (90 minutes/session), the bilateral training group had the greatest intensity of movement training. They also had the greatest improvement in range of motion at the shoulder. The unilateral training group showed the greatest reduction in spasticity. Research limitations/implications – The rationale for symmetric physiotherapy is that it might promote connections from the undamaged brain hemisphere. The robot generated copious amounts of detailed kinematic data. Even though these data provided insights into the human to machine interface using different training modalities, it proved difficult to draw neurological conclusions. It is recommended that future research along these lines should include measures of neurophysiological change and/or changes in neurological activity. Practical implications – This research suggests that the advantage of bilateral symmetric movement over other modalities is slight, and that robotic training has comparable results with standard care. If BST is used, care is potentially needed to avoid exacerbation of spasticity. Finally, this research includes a novel quantitative approach for evaluating robotic training. Originality/value – This study is of value to therapeutic researchers interested in new physiotherapy techniques, roboticists interested in developing rehabilitation devices, or for rehabilitation game designers interested in using virtual reality.},

abstract = {In neuro-rehabilitation after stroke, the conventional constrained induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been well-accepted. Existing bilateral trainings are mostly on mirrored symmetrical motion. However, complementary bilateral movements are dominantly involved in activities of daily living (ADLs), and functional bilateral therapies may bring better skill transfer from trainings to daily life. Neurophysiological evidence is also growing. In this work, we firstly introduce our bilateral arm training system realized with a haptic interface and a motion sensor, as well as the tasks that have been designed to train both the manipulation function of the paretic arm and coordination of bilateral upper limbs. Then, we propose quantitative measures for functional assessment of complementary bilateral training performance, including kinematic behavior indices, smoothness, submovement and bimanual coordination. After that, we describe the experiments with healthy subjects and the results with respect to these quantitative measures. Feasibility and sensitivity of the proposed indices were evaluated through comparison of unilateral and bilateral training outcomes. The proposed bilateral training system and tasks, as well as the quantitative measures, have been demonstrated effective for training and assessment of unilateral and bilateral arm functions.},

abstract = {The application of a robot to rehabilitation has become a matter of great concern. This paper deals with functional recovery therapy, one important aspect of physical rehabilitation. Single-joint therapy machines have already been achieved. However, for more efficient therapy, multijoint robots are necessary to achieve more realistic motion patterns. This kind of robot must have a high level of safety for humans. A pneumatic actuator may be available for such a robot, because of the compliance of compressed air. A pneumatic rubber artificial muscle manipulator has been applied to construct a therapy robot with two degrees of freedom (DOF). Also, an impedance control strategy is employed to realize various motion modes for the physical therapy modes. Further, for efficient rehabilitation, it is desirable to comprehend the physical condition of the patient. Thus, the mechanical impedance of the human arm is used as an objective evaluation of recovery, and an estimation method is proposed. Experiments show the suitability of the proposed rehabilitation robot system. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

@article{Chang2006a,
abstract = {Purpose. To investigate the effect of bilateral reaching, with/without inertial loading on the unaffected arm, on hemiparetic arm motor control in stroke. Methods. Twenty unilateral stroke patients were recruited. A three-dimensional optical motion capture system was used to measure the movement trajectory of the hemiparetic arm while performing three tasks: affected limb reaching forward; two-limb reaching forward; and two-limb reaching forward with inertia loading of 25{\%} upper limb weight on the unaffected limb, respectively. Kinematical parameters were utilized to quantify the reaching performance of the affected arm. Results. No matter whether loading was applied on the unaffected arm or not, the bilateral reaching task did not significantly facilitate smoother and faster movement. Furthermore, during bilateral reaching task with/without loading on the unaffected arm, stroke patients showed slower movement, lower maximal movement velocity, feedback control dominant and discontinuous movements in the affected arm than the same task with unilateral reaching. Subjects showed the greatest active upper extremity range of motion in proximal joints during the bilateral reaching task without unaffected arm loading. The amount of trunk movement also increased during bilateral reaching either with or without loading on the unaffected arm. Patients with moderate upper extremity motor impairment performed more discontinuous movements and less active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks; however, those with mild upper extremity motor impairment performed smoother movements and demonstrated greater active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks. Conclusions. Bilateral reaching tasks with/without loading on the unaffected arm could be considered as adding challenges during motor control training. Training with bilateral arm movements may be considered as a treatment strategy, and can be incorporated in stroke rehabilitation to facilitate greater arm active movement and improve motor control performance in the affected arm.},

abstract = {Transfer learning allows leveraging the knowledge of source domains, available a priori, to help training a classifier for a target domain, where the available data is scarce. The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target. Rather than improving the learning, brute force leveraging of a source poorly related to the target may decrease the classifier performance. One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection. The experiments demonstrate their improved performance by greatly reducing the negative transfer as the number of sources increases. TaskTrAdaBoost is a fast algorithm enabling rapid retraining over new targets. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

In this study, we want to get a stronger evidence to verify the robustness of the proposed system, controller and recovery strategy as well as to further investigate the possibility of bilateral trainings for clinical applications. To this end, ten healthy subjects took part in a 60-minute experiment. Trajectories of robots and interaction force were recorded under the proposed bilateral recovery strategy which contained four exercise modes. For mode-l and mode-2, results showed that the trajectories of master and slave robots can catch the reference trajectory very well, and be changed with active interaction force applied by participants. For mode-3 and mode-4, participants finished tasks very well by drawing the 'square-shaped' trajectories through their own force. In conclusion, the experimental results were good enough to provide a strong and positive evidence for the proposed system and controller. Moreover, according to the feedbacks from participants, the bilateral recovery strategy can be treated as a new and interesting training as compared to the traditional unilateral training, and could be tested in clinical applications further.},

@article{Almassri2018,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to predicting self-calibration in a pressure sensor using a proposed Levenberg Marquardt Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (LMBP-ANN) model. The self-calibration algorithm should be able to fix major problems in the pressure sensor such as hysteresis, variation in gain and lack of linearity with high accuracy. The traditional calibration process for this kind of sensor is a time-consuming task because it is usually done through manual and repetitive identification. Furthermore, a traditional computational method is inadequate for solving the problem since it is extremely difficult to resolve the mathematical formula among multiple confounding pressure variables. Accordingly, this paper describes a new self-calibration methodology for nonlinear pressure sensors based on an LMBP-ANN model. The proposed method was achieved using a collected dataset from pressure sensors in real time. The load cell will be used as a reference for measuring the applied force. The proposed method was validated by comparing the output pressure of the trained network with the experimental target pressure (reference). This paper also shows that the proposed model exhibited a remarkable performance than traditional methods with a max mean square error of 0.17325 and an R-value over 0.99 for the total response of training, testing and validation. To verify the proposed model's capability to build a self-calibration algorithm, the model was tested using an untrained input data set. As a result, the proposed LMBP-ANN model for self-calibration purposes is able to successfully predict the desired pressure over time, even the uncertain behaviour of the pressure sensors due to its material creep. This means that the proposed model overcomes the problems of hysteresis, variation in gain and lack of linearity over time. In return, this can be used to enhance the durability of the grasping mechanism, leading to a more robust and secure grasp for paralyzed hands. Furthermore, the exposed analysis approach in this paper can be a useful methodology for the user to evaluate the performance of any measurement system in a real-time environment.},

abstract = {Abstract:Ratio calibration of a digital voltmeter (DVM) is critical for applications such as load cell response for force measurement. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) DVM ratio service provides ratio voltage measurements that are traceable to the Josephson Voltage Standard (JVS). Previously, the service was supported by NIST JVS systems using manual measurements. The NIST JVS uses a conventional Josephson junction array which often experiences a spontaneous step transition, caused by electromagnetic interference, during its operation. An adjustment is required to obtain a stable voltage step for the ratio calibration. The programmable JVS (PJVS), developed in the last decade, uses an array with non-hysteretic steps to provide a stable voltage. The PJVS was implemented in the DVM ratio calibration service to improve the efficiency and reliability of the service. The new protocol can be executed automatically to reduce the labor cost of the calibration service. The uncertainty of t...},

abstract = {Load cells are transducers used to measure force or weight. Despite the fact that there is a wide variety of load cells, most of these transducers that are used in the weighing industry are based on strain gauges. In this paper, an s-beam load cell based on strain gauges was suitably assembled to the mechanical structure of several seats of a bus under performance tests and used to measure the resistance of their mechanical structure to tension forces applied horizontally to the seats being tested. The load cell was buried in a broadband noise background where the unwanted information and the relevant signal sometimes share a very similar frequency spectrum and its performance was improved by using a recursive least-squares (RLS) lattice algorithm. The experimental results are satisfactory and a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio at the system output of 27 dB was achieved, which is a good performance factor for judging the quality of the system. {\textcopyright} 2006 by MDPI.},

We first investigated the strain distributions of a parallel plate structure (PPS) for measuring three components of a force, a moment and a torque. We then designed a double PPS for measuring six components of forces and moments and predicted output strains. We developed a new six-component load cell including a ring-type structure using a PPS as the basic sensing element. In order to minimize coupling errors, we determined the location of strain gauges using finite element analysis and then connected the strain gauges so that bridge circuits with four strain gauges would be balanced. Calibration tests were performed to evaluate sensitivities, coupling errors and nonlinearity errors. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The load cell is able to measure the three forces and three moments and has been designed at the Politecnico di Milano (Technical University of Milan) as a result of 10 years of research in this field. The sensing structural element of the six-axis load cell is a three spoke structure constrained to the frame of the load cell by means of special joints conceived to avoid friction. Strain gauges are conveniently located on highly stressed areas. Mathematical models, both analytical and numerical, are implemented and presented in order to describe the behaviour of the load cell, to optimize its parameters and to theoretically assess its accuracy. A special device has been designed and constructed in order to accurately and quickly calibrate the load cell. Particular attention has been devoted to the processing of the strain gauges signals. An electronic DSP board, located inside the load cell, has been realized able to compute the six components of the generalized force from the strain gauge signals and return six voltage signals proportional to the measured forces. Software selectable filters and gains are implemented on the DSP board. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

abstract = {This paper considers the estimation and prediction of a high-dimensional
linear regression in the setting of transfer learning, using samples from the
target model as well as auxiliary samples from different but possibly related
regression models. When the set of "informative" auxiliary samples is known, an
estimator and a predictor are proposed and their optimality is established. The
optimal rates of convergence for prediction and estimation are faster than the
corresponding rates without using the auxiliary samples. This implies that
knowledge from the informative auxiliary samples can be transferred to improve
the learning performance of the target problem. In the case that the set of
informative auxiliary samples is unknown, we propose a data-driven procedure
for transfer learning, called Trans-Lasso, and reveal its robustness to
non-informative auxiliary samples and its efficiency in knowledge transfer. The
proposed procedures are demonstrated in numerical studies and are applied to a
dataset concerning the associations among gene expressions. It is shown that
Trans-Lasso leads to improved performance in gene expression prediction in a
target tissue by incorporating the data from multiple different tissues as
auxiliary samples.},

The proposed force sensor uses load cells to identify the amount of applied force in each direction independently which makes it more suitable for Human-Robot Interaction purposes. This paper also proposes a novel calibration setup to excite force sensors in all directions accurately. Once the output data of load cell of the force sensor is gathered, an experimental identification procedure based on Least Square method is applied in order to identify the output model of the sensor. Accomplishing the development process, a force sensor is produced with a reasonable precision of 0.1N in x and y-axes and 0.2N in z-axis, within a range of 5N which is suitable for Human-Robot Interaction applications.},
