\section{Conclusion}
The survey search on bilateral rehabilitation robots shows that a bilateral approach to rehabilitation is more engaging to the patient involved and it also so significant increases in some outcome measures and particular tasks and ADLâ€™s.\\
The cascaded force-torque arrangement shows the viability of using 1-D load cells to create higher axis force sensors but it has yet to be seen if the results can be made comparable or better than a commercial grade 3-axis force sensor.
